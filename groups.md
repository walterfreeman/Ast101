This page has group information listed for everyone in our class. Make sure you find your own listing. (Unless you are Andrew Dinnhaupt, the first listing isn't yours!)

Students are listed in alphabetical order by email address. It will be easiest if you search for your own name. You may have to search a couple of times, since your name will 
appear in the information for other students who are in your group or who will be sending you their work for evaluation.

#### Jiaxing Natalia Deng Yuan, jdengyua@syr.edu

You weren't assigned a group because it looks like you have groupmates who want to work with you, but who did not fill the survey out
		listing the same time as you. Instead of putting you with a random group, we decided to give you and your group a chance to fix this.
		Contact the people you are hoping to work with and figure out what time you want your lab group to meet. Then one of you should email 
		<skundu@syr.edu> with your decision. He will sort the groups out for you. Don't worry -- you'll get a little extra time on Project 1.

#### Jake Kurtz, jkurtz01@syr.edu

You weren't assigned a group because it looks like you have groupmates who want to work with you, but who did not fill the survey out
		listing the same time as you. Instead of putting you with a random group, we decided to give you and your group a chance to fix this.
		Contact the people you are hoping to work with and figure out what time you want your lab group to meet. Then one of you should email 
		<skundu@syr.edu> with your decision. He will sort the groups out for you. Don't worry -- you'll get a little extra time on Project 1.

#### Matteo Ficarella, mificare@syr.edu

You weren't assigned a group because it looks like you have groupmates who want to work with you, but who did not fill the survey out
		listing the same time as you. Instead of putting you with a random group, we decided to give you and your group a chance to fix this.
		Contact the people you are hoping to work with and figure out what time you want your lab group to meet. Then one of you should email 
		<skundu@syr.edu> with your decision. He will sort the groups out for you. Don't worry -- you'll get a little extra time on Project 1.

#### Ryan Kalata, rakalata@syr.edu

You weren't assigned a group because it looks like you have groupmates who want to work with you, but who did not fill the survey out
		listing the same time as you. Instead of putting you with a random group, we decided to give you and your group a chance to fix this.
		Contact the people you are hoping to work with and figure out what time you want your lab group to meet. Then one of you should email 
		<skundu@syr.edu> with your decision. He will sort the groups out for you. Don't worry -- you'll get a little extra time on Project 1.

#### Sydney Lance, sjlance@syr.edu

You weren't assigned a group because it looks like you have groupmates who want to work with you, but who did not fill the survey out
		listing the same time as you. Instead of putting you with a random group, we decided to give you and your group a chance to fix this.
		Contact the people you are hoping to work with and figure out what time you want your lab group to meet. Then one of you should email 
		<skundu@syr.edu> with your decision. He will sort the groups out for you. Don't worry -- you'll get a little extra time on Project 1.

#### Thomas Farrell, tjfarrel@syr.edu

You weren't assigned a group because it looks like you have groupmates who want to work with you, but who did not fill the survey out
		listing the same time as you. Instead of putting you with a random group, we decided to give you and your group a chance to fix this.
		Contact the people you are hoping to work with and figure out what time you want your lab group to meet. Then one of you should email 
		<skundu@syr.edu> with your decision. He will sort the groups out for you. Don't worry -- you'll get a little extra time on Project 1.
