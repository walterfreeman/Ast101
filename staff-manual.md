# Astronomy 101 Staff Manual

Welcome to the Astronomy 101 teaching team! This document will serve both as an introduction to your duties and as a reference during the semester.

This document is written for both TA's and coaches. Students will also be able to read it, for transparency.

*This is one of the most unique TA assignments in our department.* Most of our classes focus on teaching students technical skills to prepare
them for technical careers that they are pursuing. But AST101 students come from mostly nontechnical majors: everything from business to 
magazine journalism to creative writing. For many of them, we will be the last science class they ever take. 

We hope to teach them some technical
aspects of astronomy, of course: why the stars, sun, and moon move in the way they do; the history of our understanding of the solar system and 
its nature; spectroscopy and thermal radiation; and the history and future of spaceflight.

However, because our students primarily come from nontechnical backgrounds, we will need to step away from our usual technical vocabulary and help them
learn using the language that they have: diagrams, words, narratives, pictures, and so forth. Their knowledge of algebra, physics, and mathematics
is very basic, but this does not mean that they lack intelligence or the ability to understand technical ideas using the language they have.

Some folks deride classes like this one as "astrophysics for poets". But my approach is to lean into that notion: part of our mission is to help our
students see the poetry of astrophysics. We are emissaries from the beautiful field of physics, and our remit is to share that beauty with the students
who show up in our class. We want them to leave our class having both basic scientific literacy but also an appreciation for what science is, how it 
works, its role in our world, and how they can share in the grand mission to understand the Cosmos and use that understanding to enrich the human experience.

This class is a large undertaking: we have hundreds of students and a large teaching team, all working toward a common purpose: 
helping our students see the connections between the technical aspects of astronomy, its beauty, and the human experience more broadly.
We want them to leave our class knowing something about the heavens -- but also with some knowledge of what science is, and a positive impression
of our discipline.

### Collegiality

We'll all be working closely together this semester (professors, TA's, and students), and it's vitally important that we do this in a supportive, collegial, positive way. 

I see GTA's as *junior professional instructors*, not as minions. You all will have your own ideas about how best to run things in your own labs. 
That's fantastic: as teaching professionals in your own right, you *should* have your own ideas and act on them.
If you want to "get off script" -- if you see a need to do something different than we've planned in order to best help your students learn -- 
please feel free to do it! (Let us know afterwards, of course!) Any input or feedback you have on our course is extremely valuable. 

If you have any suggestions for how we can improve things, please let me know. 
You will have good ideas; please present those to the rest of us! Likewise, you will recognize some of my suggestions as bad ideas -- please tell me so! 

Also, if you need help or support of any kind -- someone to cover your class while you're sick or while you study for a hard exam, or someone to help
you grade your labs for a week -- please ask.

### Communication

We will use Slack for internal communications using a private channel on the SU Physics team. Please ping Walter for an invite if you don't
have one already. You should get the Slack client for your phones and computers; it is the best way for us to communicate quickly and
can be a lot more efficient than either email or GroupMe threads. 

### Your Roles

In our class, TA's will have a few main duties. 

* Lead lab sections (6 hours/week)
* Support students in the Physics Clinic; your time in the Clinic will also serve as your office hours (2 hours/week)
* Collaborate with the other TA's in weekly staff meetings (1 hour/week)
* Grade students' lab work (2 hours/week)
* Correspond with students to answer their questions and help them learn (< 2 hours/week)
* Proctor exams (grading will be handled by machine) (1 hour/week average)
* Grade written papers (1 hour/week average)

We anticipate that your job will average around 14-15 hours a week. If you find yourself spending more time than this on
your work, please get in touch with me (Walter) and we'll discuss ways to reduce your workload. 

### Dealing With Emergencies

If you are going to miss a lab section and have advance warning, arrange to swap with another TA; that's not a problem.

However, if you're going to miss a lab section without much warning -- you missed your bus, you overslept,
you have a medical emergency -- then your first priority should be to *get someone to Holden Observatory* to cover for you.

You should do the following:

* Send a message to #ast101staff on Discord asking someone to cover for you. If there's no answer in two minutes...
* Call Walter at (xxx) xxx xxxx and then the head TA at (xxx) xxx xxxx in that order. (Numbers pinned in staff Slack.) If you can't get them...
* Call the Physics Department office at (315) 443 3901 if it's between 8am and 6pm
* If it becomes apparent you're going to be more than five minutes late and nobody can cover, email your students. (Note that you will have access to a 
Blackboard page for your lab section. We won't be using those Blackboard pages for anything, since we will be putting grades in the master section, but 
you will have a listing of your students and an ability to send them email through there.) 

If you have a student who is being disruptive and doesn't stop, ask them to leave the classroom.
If a student is being *extremely* disruptive to the point where it jeopardizes the wellbeing of the other folks in the room, 
please do whatever you need to do to protect your safety and the safety of your students, 
including calling the Department of Public Safety at (315) 443 2224. (This is very rare but it has happened).

### Maintaining the Lab

Since Holden Observatory is a standalone building, it sometimes doesn't have the same attention from maintenance staff as the Physics Building.
You may notice the following:

* Heating and cooling problems
* Plumbing problems in the bathroom
* A need for custodial services (bathroom supplies, general cleaning) resulting from the very high traffic

If any of these come up, please send a message to staff Slack and send an email to the Physics Department office.

If we have equipment that is broken, please tell everyone over staff Slack and we will try to get a workaround or replacement to you.

### Interacting With Students

* Students have been through a lot lately, and we need to strike a good balance between ensuring our students work hard to learn physics and recognizing that sometimes other things will intrude on our classroom. 
Most students are at the age where psychological problems like depression and anxiety naturally manifest. If you notice any of our students showing signs of emotional distress, 
or disengaging from class (not attending, showing up but not working), please let Walter know. I'll contact the student and see what kind of support they need, and refer them to 
the university's professional support resources (for instance, the Barnes Center) as appropriate. You can also speak to the student yourself if you are comfortable. Keep in mind
that we are well equipped to provide academic support (helping students learn astronomy or understand how to get the most out of this course or their education), but we are not
equipped to provide medical care or therapy; in these situations, please refer students to the Barnes Center or call Student Support and Outreach and request that they assist the
student.

* Likewise, if you or anyone else on the teaching staff is having a hard time (with this class that you are teaching, with your other classes that you are taking, 
or other things happening in your life), please let me know. 

* Many students see coursework as a minefield of "wrong answers" through which they must walk in order to find the elusive "right answer". 
This mentality is **not helpful**, and leads to students associating error with failure. We all know this isn't the case, 
but we need to be vigilant to make sure we're not perpetuating this mindset that some students have. Thus, when you're interacting with students:

    * Let the student know that you think they can succeed. (They almost certainly can!)
    * Instead of focusing on things they did wrong, find the kernels of physical insight that they *do* have and build from there. 
    * It's better to observe them working and point out mistakes at that point -- physics is a process, not a set of answers, and we can help them learn best if we can diagnose their misconceptions from that process rather than only the finished product.
    * Remember that **errors do not mean the student is a failure** -- they just give us insight on what the student has yet to learn.
    
* However, if a student is **not** putting forth effort or making an earnest attempt to understand astronomy, it is not your fault and you shouldn't take it personally.
We cannot put in the work required to learn astronomy for our students. They have to do the work; if they're not willing to do that, it's not our problem. If a hardworking
student would benefit from our hard work to help them -- we should work hard for them. If a student who is not engaged or not trying asks for us to rearrange the course
to accommodate their laziness, then we have better things to do. (We should still treat them with basic dignity, of course, but they may wind up with a dignified failing grade.)

* **Harassment, exclusion, bullying, and the like are not acceptable in our class.** Physics has a place for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from. 
If you see any dynamics that act to exclude anyone from feeling welcome -- including pathological group dynamics where one person railroads everyone else, 
or one person doesn't have a chance to contribute -- please intervene if you can and/or contact Walter or other senior teaching staff. Likewise, if you see that a student needs accommodations
to fully benefit from our class and feel welcome, please let me know so I can fix the problem.


## TA duties in detail

Your chief responsibility will be to teach labs. These labs are a core part of the class, where your students will practice skills
and explore topics outside the scope of what they do in lecture and homework. There are around 30 lab sections in AST101, held
in Holden Observatory.

Since astronomy is a particular perspective on the world and a set of skills, rather than a list of facts, 
students _cannot_ learn the essence of astronomy without lots of practice -- and without a skilled guide by their side. 
Learning physics is like learning to play the piano: all the teacher can do is provide advice, but it's up to the 
pianist to do the hard work of sitting down at the piano and training their fingers and mind to play the instrument.

For each lab, we will provide a set of activities -- exercises for the students in which they explore the workings of the cosmos 
that are designed to guide them through the skills they are learning. You will spend most of your time walking around the room and talking to students, 
responding to their questions, and asking them leading questions of your own designed to gently guide them toward insight. 

### Group Work

On the first day of lab, have the students sort themselves into groups of three (with one or two groups of two). 
You may do this in any way you want. As a general rule, it is best if the number of women/nonbinary people in a group
is 0, 2, or 3; it is not a good idea to have a group of one woman and two men. When possible, when you have multiple students
who share a salient minoritized identity, assign them to the same group.

These groups should be static during the semester, unless a student disengages from the class or a group has
problems. In that case, reassign groups as you see fit (on a permanent basis). If a student is absent from a group, the remaining two people should work together;
if two students are absent, reassign the lone member to another group (making it temporarily a group of four). 

Students will be completing a group evaluation at the end of the semester where they evaluate their groupmates. This will 
serve as an accountability mechanism; students know this is coming, and it will provide an incentive for them to come to lab
and collaborate well.

If a student attends your section who is not scheduled for that section (with your permission), assign them to a group, preferentially a shorthanded one.

### Grading labs

A significant part of your work is grading the students' lab work. By default, you should grade students' labs within a week so you can
return them when they come to lab the following week. If this is not possible in any given week, please let us know so we can make arrangements
to get you support and help.

**Students earn grades based on the work they do in lab, not based on the things they write down on their lab handout**. The lab handout is merely
a physical artifact of the student's work, and correct answers on their lab handout do not guarantee students credit. We encourage you to keep a 
notebook during your lab section with a roster of your students, taking brief notes as you circulate about students' engagement and collaboration.
(This can be as simple as "+" or "-" signs for their work, either collectively or individually.) 

This will let you assign them grades later on based on their learning and teamwork, not just looking at what have written on the labs they submit.


#### Grading labs quickly

It will be easiest for you to read through only one lab submission per group. Assign everyone in the group the same grade, modified by what you wrote down 
during lab. 

For instance, suppose that Alice, Bob, and Charlie are together in a group. During lab you noticed that Alice kept asking you excellent questions and was 
working hard to help Bob understand the material. Bob was asking questions and learning from Alice. Charlie was goofing off during much of the time. 
You might record during lab that Alice's grade should be higher than the written record reflects (+), but Charlie's should be substantially lower (--). 

When you look at their written work, you choose Bob's lab to look at. (You see that Charlie wasn't really doing much, so it would be unfair to Alice and Bob
to look at his.) You observe that Bob has written down reasonable things that generally reflect an understanding of the material, but have some errors that 
mean that there are things he doesn't understand. You assess its quality as 85%.

You might assign Bob an 85%, then assign Alice a 95% (modified upward by +10% for her excellent participation in lab) and Charlie a 70% (modified downward by 
-15% for his lack of engagement).  

Write their numerical grade at the top of each of their papers, then return them at the beginning of the next lab. If you assign one group member a different
grade than the other people in their group, and you remember why, optionally put a brief note explaining why, particularly if it is higher (i.e. "Great questions
during lab!" on Alice's paper in the prior example).

You may also give students high grades based on your memory or record of their work in lab with only a cursory look at their submissions. For instance, if you
recall that a group worked hard and understood a lab, you can give them all 100% after only a cursory look through one of the submissions.

#### Entering Grades

Students at Syracuse University are extremely acculturated to seeing grades on Blackboard and evaluating their quality as students by the numerical values
that they see there. In many students' minds, even if they have received a paper back with a grade written on it, that grade doesn't "count" until it is in 
Blackboard. The mobile Blackboard app's interface presents students a prominent "bottom line" grade and the sub-grades that go into it whenever they access it; 
if this is not accurate, many students will be extremely anxious about their academic performance even if they are doing fine (and even if you have returned
all their work with grades telling them so).

Thus, we need to keep the electronic record of students' grades up to date. If you're not able to post students' lab grades on Blackboard within a week,
please let me know.

### Prelabs

Each lab will have a prelab. If the students don't do the prelab, they can't come to lab that week. They may -- once during the semester -- do their prelab and then
go to another lab section.

### Lab Section Switches

A student may switch lab sections once during the semester and attend a different one than they are assigned to. (Not doing their prelab counts here.) 

They do this by emailing another lab TA and cc:ing you, asking that TA if they may attend (space permitting), 
and -- after approval -- going to the other section. If a student emails you and your section is
full (meaning: 21 students consistently attend, or you already have multiple people switching into it), 
then you should apologize and tell them that you are full. They should also contact their group, as professional courtesy,
and say that they will be absent.

If a student needs to switch labs multiple times, please use your judgment in allowing them to do this, weighing the reason for the switches and your experience
with the student. (For instance, a student who has a medical appointment during your lab and then a follow-up two weeks later should be able to switch
both times.)

## Weekly Staff Meetings

We'll have a weekly staff meeting on Friday 2-3pm in Holden where we discuss the following week's lab and how the class is going. 
Everyone is expected to attend all of these.

### Homework and Quizzes

Students will be doing homework assignments during the semester, but it will not be graded (by you or anyone else). 

They will have weekly quizzes that relate to homework (mostly) and lecture and lab (somewhat). These will be completed on Blackboard and will be graded automatically.
Your interaction with these will involve only fielding grading questions from students when they come to your labs.

### Exams

We will have three midterm exams and a final. These will be multiple choice exams on Scantron forms (so we don't have to grade them by hand). 

We'll need a few proctors on exam days in class to answer student questions. During the final we'll need everyone available to help proctor.

### Paper Grading

We will be discussing the process of science in our class, and students will write a paper on pseudoscientific claims/science denialism later in the term. 
They will have one lab that is really a writing workshop, where they present the scenario they will write about and the fallacies present in it.

You'll be responsible for grading these papers. We'll talk about this more as the time comes (and will post a rubric here and in the assignment). 
Grading these will be a fair bit of work (10 minutes per student, perhaps), which you can split over several weeks.
