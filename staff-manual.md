# Astronomy 101 Staff Manual (draft)

Welcome to the Astronomy 101 teaching team! This document will serve both as an introduction to your duties and as a reference during the semester.

This document is written for both TA's and coaches. Students will also be able to read it, for transparency.

*This is one of the most unique TA assignments in our department.* Most of our classes focus on teaching students technical skills to prepare
them for technical careers that they are pursuing. But AST101 students come from mostly nontechnical majors: everything from business to 
magazine journalism to creative writing. For many of them, we will be the last science class they ever take. 

We hope to teach them some technical
aspects of astronomy, of course: why the stars, sun, and moon move in the way they do; the history of our understanding of the solar system and 
its nature; spectroscopy and thermal radiation; and the history and future of spaceflight.

However, because our students primarily come from nontechnical backgrounds, we will need to step away from our usual technical vocabulary and help them
learn using the language that they have: diagrams, words, narratives, pictures, and so forth. Their knowledge of algebra, physics, and mathematics
is very basic, but this does not mean that they lack intelligence or the ability to understand technical ideas using the language they have.

Some folks deride classes like this one as "astrophysics for poets". But my approach is to lean into that notion: part of our mission is to help our
students see the poetry of astrophysics. We are emissaries from the beautiful field of physics, and our remit is to share that beauty with the students
who show up in our class. We want them to leave our class having both basic scientific literacy but also an appreciation for what science is, how it 
works, its role in our world, and how they can share in the grand mission to understand the Cosmos and use that understanding to enrich the human experience.

This class is a large undertaking: we have six hundred students and a teaching team of a dozen, all working toward a common purpose: 
helping our students see the connections between the technical aspects of astronomy, its beauty, and the human experience more broadly.
We want them to leave our class knowing something about the heavens -- but also with some knowledge of what science is, and a positive impression
of our discipline.

### Collegiality

We'll all be working closely together this semester (professors, TA's, coaches, and students), and it's vitally important that we do this in a supportive, collegial, positive way. 

I see GTA's and coaches as *junior professional instructors*, not as minions. You all will have your own ideas about how best to run things in your own labs. 
That's fantastic: as teaching professionals in your own right, you *should* have your own ideas and act on them.
If you want to "get off script" -- if you see a need to do something different than we've planned in order to best help your students learn -- 
please feel free to do it! (Let us know afterwards, of course!) 
Any input or feedback you have on our course is extremely valuable. 

If you have any suggestions for how we can improve things, please let me know. 
iYou will have good ideas; please present those to the rest of us! Likewise, you will recognize some of my suggestions as bad ideas -- please tell me so! 

Also, if you need help or support of any kind -- someone to cover your class while you're sick or while you study for a hard exam, 
advice for any issues that arise, or even just someone to talk to about your career plans and challenges in grad school -- please ask. 

### Communication

We will use Slack for internal communications using a private channel on the SU Physics team. Please ping Walter for an invite if you don't
have one already.
Please get the Slack client for your phones and computers; it is the best way for us to communicate quickly and
can be a lot more efficient than either email or GroupMe threads. 

We will use Discord as a means of communication with the students, though it is not required that either they or we use it.
You may join the Discord server at <https://discord.gg/M52DajmqMV>. Ping Walter once you're there for the coach/TA role.

### Your Roles

In our class, TA's will have a few main duties. 

* Lead lab sections (6 hours/week)
* Support students in the Physics Clinic; your time in the Clinic will also serve as your office hours (2 hours/week)
* Collaborate with the other TA's in weekly staff meetings (1 hour/week)
* Grade students' lab work and homework assignments (2 hours/week)
* Correspond with students to answer their questions and help them learn (< 2 hours/week)
* Proctor quizzes (grading will be handled by machine) (1 hour/week)
* Grade written papers (1 hour/week)

We anticipate that your job will average around 14-15 hours a week. If you find yourself spending more time than this on
your work, please get in touch with me (Walter) and we'll discuss ways to reduce your workload. 

Coaches, on the other hand, will focus on answering students' questions during the active learning portion of the class.
They will: 

* Attend lecture sections as available 
* Potentially do homework grading during the "non-tutorial" portion of the class
* **During tutorials, roam around the auditorium answering student questions** (your main job)
* Answer student questions on Discord, both during lecture and otherwise
* Hold office hours if you are comfortable doing so (online or in person)
* Collaborate with other coaches during a weekly meeting 
* Provide students assistance with their papers if you are comfortable doing so, with Kiersten taking primary responsibility for this

We will pay you by the hour for this work.

I'll discuss each of these in detail at the end. Coaches -- if you ever want more or fewer working hours (since you are paid by the hour), please let me know and we can either reduce your workload 
or find more stuff for you to do. 

### Dealing With Emergencies

If you are going to miss a lab section and have advance warning, swap with another TA; that's not a problem.

If you are a coach and must miss class, it is not an emergency. Just let Walter know (via Discord).

However, if you're going to miss a lab section without much warning -- you missed your bus, you overslept,
you have a medical emergency -- then your first priority should be to *get someone to Holden Observatory* to cover for you.

You should do the following:

* Send a message to #ast101staff on Discord asking someone to cover for you. If there's no answer in two minutes...
* Call Walter at (520) 409 3766 and then Patrick at (xxx) xxx xxxx in that order. If you can't get them...
* Call the Physics Department office at (315) 443 3901 if it's between 8am and 6pm
* If it becomes apparent you're going to be more than five minutes late and nobody can cover, write a message to #ast101
in Discord and then email your students.

If you have a student who is being disruptive and doesn't stop, ask them to leave the classroom.
If a student is being *extremely* disruptive to the point where it jeopardizes the wellbeing of the other folks in the room, 
please do whatever you need to do to protect your safety and the safety of your students, including calling the Department of Public Safety at (315) 443 2224. (This is very rare but it has happened).


### Interacting With Students

* Even though we will be back in person, this year will still be hard on everyone,
and we need to strike a good balance between ensuring our students work hard to learn physics and recognizing that sometimes other things will intrude on our classroom. 
Most students are at the age where psychological problems like depression and anxiety naturally manifest. If you notice any of our students showing signs of emotional distress, 
or disengaging from class (not attending, showing up but not working), please let Walter or Patrick know. We'll contact the student and see what kind of support they need.

* Likewise, if you or anyone else on the teaching staff is having a hard time (with this class that you are teaching, with your other classes that you are taking, 
or other things happening in your life), please let me know. *We will help you* -- I have gone to the mat to support physics coaches/TA's who need help and I'll
do it again if you need anything. If you don't feel comfortable talking to me (Walter), you may go to Patrick Adams (TA) or Kiersten Andrews (coach) for confidential 
advice. 

* Many students see coursework as a minefield of "wrong answers" through which they must walk in order to find the elusive "right answer". 
This mentality is **not helpful**, and leads to students associating error with failure. We all know this isn't the case, 
but we need to be vigilant to make sure we're not perpetuating this mindset that some students have. Thus, when you're interacting with students:

    * Let the student know that you think they can succeed. (They almost certainly can!)
    * Instead of focusing on things they did wrong, find the kernels of physical insight that they *do* have and build from there. 
    * It's better to observe them working and point out mistakes at that point -- physics is a process, not a set of answers, and we can help them learn best if we can diagnose their misconceptions from that process rather than only the finished product.
    * On homework, when possible, give them insight into the nature of their errors. Remember: **errors do not mean the student is a failure** -- they just give us insight on what the student has yet to learn.
    
* However, if a student is **not** putting forth effort or making an earnest attempt to understand astronomy, it is not your fault and you shouldn't take it personally.
We cannot put in the work required to learn astronomy for our students. They have to do the work; if they're not willing to do that, it's not our problem. If a hardworking
student would benefit from our hard work to help them -- we should work hard for them. If a student who is not engaged or not trying asks for us to rearrange the course
to accommodate their laziness, then we have better things to do. (We should still treat them with basic dignity, of course, but they may wind up with a dignified failing grade.)

* **Harassment, exclusion, bullying, and the like are not acceptable in our class.** Physics has a place for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from. 
If you see any dynamics that act to exclude anyone from feeling welcome -- including pathological group dynamics where one person railroads everyone else, 
or one person doesn't have a chance to contribute -- please intervene if you can and/or contact Walter, Patrick, or Kiersten. Likewise, if you see that a student needs accommodations
to fully benefit from our class and feel welcome, please let me know so I can fix the problem.


### Health and Safety

#### Sick time

Coaches earn one hour of sick time for every thirty hours worked. This means that, for every thirty hours you work, you may miss one hour of work due to illness and still get paid for it.

Note:

* time spent getting a COVID booster vaccine, traveling to a vaccination site, or recuperating from its effects counts -- if you have to miss a shift because you are getting your COVID vaccine, claim it as sick time!
* mental illness, or things necessary for your mental wellbeing, count. If you need to take a "mental health break", you may do so and get paid for it. *It is your right as a New York State employee*. 

#### COVID safety protocols

If you are especially vulnerable to serious complications from a COVID infection and wish to have your work duties modified to reduce the risk to you, please
discuss this with Walter as soon as possible.

The situation will likely be in a great deal of flux as the semester elapses. For now, we should wear masks when in instructional spaces with our students indoors.

We will need to be flexible in responding to issues involving sick students. We should strongly dissuade students from coming to class if they are feeling sick.
How we respond to students missing work (lab, quizzes) because of illness will need to evolve as the semester goes on; we will set protocols based
on how many students are affected.

If anyone on the teaching staff contracts COVID, obviously you should take as much time off work as you need to recover.

If a student is not wearing a mask if we are in a COVID alert status that requires this, 
or if they are a student required to wear a mask by SU administration,
offer them one from the classroom supply. If they don't put it on and don't offer a reason why they cannot, ask them to leave. 
If they are unwilling to do this and become confrontational, do whatever you need to protect yourself and the class, and call for backup (ping @channel in #ast101staff and/or call Walter,
the Physics Department office, or Public Safety.

Currently all students are required to wear masks in the classroom, as are we. If this changes, we will show you how to look up which students are 
required to wear a mask at all times using Orange Success.


#### Backups, coverage, and support

We expect you to prioritize your health and wellbeing over teaching astronomy. If you are ill, experiencing a great deal of stress,
are not able to get enough sleep, or something like that, please let me or Patrick know. We will get coverage for you during your
section, get you some backup in grading papers, or whatever it is that you need. I can't emphasize this enough: 
**please ask for support**. We have lots of people teaching this class and we *can* get someone there to back you up if you need it.


## TA duties in detail

Your chief responsibility will be to teach labs. These labs are a core part of the class, where your students will practice skills
and explore topics outside the scope of what they do in lecture and homework. There are around 30 lab sections in AST101, held
in Holden Observatory.

Since astronomy is a particular perspective on the world and a set of skills, rather than a list of facts, 
students _cannot_ learn the essence of astronomy without lots of practice -- and without a skilled guide by their side. 
Learning physics is like learning to play the piano: all the teacher can do is provide advice, but it's up to the 
pianist to do the hard work of sitting down at the piano and training their fingers and mind to play the instrument.

For each lab, we will provide a set of activities -- exercises for the students in which they explore the workings of the cosmos 
that are designed to guide them through the skills they are learning. You will spend most of your time walking around the room and talking to students, 
responding to their questions, and asking them leading questions of your own designed to gently guide them toward insight. 

### Group Work

On the first day of lab, have the students sort themselves into groups of three (with one or two groups of two). 
You may do this in any way you want. As a general rule, it is best if the number of women/nonbinary people in a group
is 0, 2, or 3; it is not a good idea to have a group of one woman and two men. 

These groups should be pretty persistent from section to section, but fluidity is fine in response to complaints or
students joining and leaving.

These groups should be static during the semester, unless a student disengages from the class or a group has
problems. In that case, reassign groups as you see fit. If a student is absent from a group, the remaining two people should work together;
if two students are absent, reassign the lone member to another group (making it temporarily a group of four). 

If a student attends your section who is not scheduled for that section (with your permission), assign them to a group, preferentially a shorthanded one.

### Grading labs

**Students earn grades based on the work they do in lab, not based on the things they write down on their lab handout**. The lab handout is merely
a physical artifact of the student's work, and correct answers on their lab handout do not guarantee students credit. We encourage you to keep a 
notebook during your lab section with a roster of your students, taking brief notes as you circulate about students' engagement and collaboration.
(This can be as simple as "+" or "-" signs for their work, either collectively or individually.) 

This will let you assign them grades later on based on their learning and teamwork, not just looking at what they submitted.

We should grade labs on a six-point scale:

* **S**: The student asked excellent questions, went above the norm in helping their groupmates learn, and expressed themselves clearly and articulately.
They are clearly interested in a depth of knowledge, not just "doing the exercises". *Grades of S should be rare, and based on what you observe in lab
directly, not just what the student writes, unless it is truly exceptional.* Counts as 110% in the average.
* **A**: The student understands the material thoroughly and well; they completed the lab as intended, worked with their group, asked questions when needed,
and left the lab having achieved our goals. Counts as 90% in the average. *(Note that the A range is 80-100%.)*
* **B**: The student understood most of the material, but lacks understanding of some elements OR the student understands the material well, but did not 
collaborate effectively with their group. Counts as 75% in the average. *(Note that the B range is 65-80%.)*
* **C**: The student's understanding has significant gaps, and the student didn't ask appropriate questions or engage with their group in order to 
remediate them. Counts as 60% in the average. *(Note that the C range is 55-65%.)*
* **D**: The student was only participating marginally in the activity -- arriving late, continually not paying attention, etc. They learned very little. Counts as 40%.
* **F**: The student did no meaningful work or did not show up. Counts as 0%.

#### Example of Grading

It will be easiest for you to read through only one lab submission per group. Assign everyone in the group the same grade, modified by what you wrote down 
during lab. 

For instance, suppose that Alice, Bob, and Charlie are together in a group. During lab you noticed that Alice kept asking you excellent questions and was 
working hard to help Bob understand the material. Bob was asking questions and learning from Alice. Charlie was goofing off during much of the time. 
You might record during lab that Alice's grade should be higher than the written record reflects (+), but Charlie's should be substantially lower (--). 

When you look at their written work, you choose Bob's lab to look at. (You see that Charlie wasn't really doing much, so it would be unfair to Alice and Bob
to look at his.) You observe that Bob has written down reasonable things that reflect a solid A-level understanding. You award Alice an S (A modified upward
for her work during lab), Bob an A, and Charlie a C (modified significantly downward for his lack of participation).

You record these grades in the shared Google document and on each of their papers, then return them at the beginning of the next lab.

### Feedback

After each lab section, I'd like you to take two minutes to provide some feedback about how the students are doing. This may seem like a silly bit of trivia,
but it is essential for me to keep tabs on how things are going and make changes as needed. You can do this on your phone in a dedicated Slack channel we will set up.

### Prelabs

Each lab will have a prelab. If the students don't do the prelab, they can't come to lab that week. They may -- once during the semester -- do their prelab and then
go to another lab section.

### Lab Section Switches

A student may -- *once* during the semester -- switch lab sections without a good reason. (Not doing their prelab counts here.) 

They do this by emailing another lab TA and cc:ing you, asking that TA if they may attend (space permitting), and -- after approval -- going to the other section.

If they are sick or have an academic-related reason, it does not use up their free switch.

## Weekly Staff Meetings

We'll have a weekly staff meeting on Friday 2-3pm in Holden where we discuss the following week's lab and how the class is going. 
You are expected to attend all of these.

### Homework

The homework component of this class is new this year, so there will be some bugs to knock out. They will submit homework either on Blackboard or 
as written work to you. Grading duties will be split between you and the coaches.

The primary goal of the homework here is *for the students to learn*. We will be grading it, but do not knock yourself out over the grading. The primary goal
of giving grades to the homework is so the students will do it; it is not to sort out who will get which grade.

Since the format of the homework will vary from time to time, the grading rubric will too. We will keep you informed about grading practices for homework;
they will evolve as the semester progresses.

#### Maintaining Gradebooks

We will maintain grades on either Blackboard or a shared Google document, shared only with your @g.syr.edu accounts. 

In the first two weeks of class, we'll create a separate "Smart View" of each TA's students on Blackboard. You are responsible for grading your students' homework and in-class exams, and for keeping up with their recitation assessments. We hope to have coaches help with some of the grading.

Every week, we will ask you for an update on your grading. If you are a bit behind on grading, that is not a big deal. But if you are falling seriously behind, _ask for help_. 

### Exams

We will have a number (probably five) midterm mini-exams and a final.

We'll need a few proctors on those days in class to answer student questions (who may be TA's or coaches). During the final we'll need all hands on deck to help proctor.

### Paper Grading

We will be discussing the process of science in our class, and students will write a paper on pseudoscience/science denialism later in the term. Earlier in the semester they will write a paper 
relating timekeeping to motions in the sky. 

You'll be responsible for grading these papers. We'll talk about this more as the time comes. Grading these will be a fair bit of work.
