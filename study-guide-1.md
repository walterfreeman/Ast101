# Study guide for Unit 1

In this unit, we studied:

* the actual motions of the Earth, the Sun, the planets, and the stars
* how these cause the apparent motions of the things in the night sky
* the "celestial sphere model" which describes their motions to some degree of accuracy, and why it works
* how the motions of the Earth and Moon cause the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets to differ from the celestial sphere model.

I'll talk about each in turn. However, this review doesn't contain pictures, and **this unit is all about geometry**. It is up to you to draw these diagrams for yourself,
find them in the lecture slides, review your **Lecture Tutorials**, and read the textbook. This unit, more than any other, requires active problem-solving on your part, not just recall
of the laws of nature. This is just a list of what you need to be familiar with, **not** the only thing you should read to study. You are responsible for going back through your notes,
the book, the **Tutorials**, the slides, and the like and working through examples. There will be problems on this exam where you're presented with a diagram and have to figure stuff out
from it.

Study tips:

* draw a picture
* use your fingers to point in three dimensions and trace the paths of things in the sky
* draw a bigger picture
* no, really, draw a picture :)
* use your Earth beach-ball to help you visualize things in 3D!

### Our local neighborhood: stuff to know

* The Sun is the center of the solar system. It moves only slightly (mostly due to Jupiter's gravity); these motions aren't important here.
* The planets orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits that are nearly circular. The Earth, in particular, orbits the Sun at a distance of 1 AU, once per year. The outer planets range from 
5 to 30 AU from the Sun.
* The Moon orbits the Earth at a distance of 0.0025 AU, once every 28 days.
* The Earth rotates on its axis once every sidereal day (a bit less than 24 hours). 
* The stars are very far away (the closest is 276,000 AU away). 
* All of these rotations and revolutions are counterclockwise when viewed looking down on the solar system from the north celestial pole

### The celestial sphere model

* The fastest motion of all of these is the rotation of the Earth.
* In the time it takes the Earth to rotate once, the objects in the sky don't really move much relative to each other
* Thus, the dominant apparent motion of all things in the sky is due to the Earth's rotation underneath them; things rise in the East and set in the West.
* We can pretend that everything in the sky is attached to a large sphere, rotating around us while we stay stationary. This isn't literally true, but is a convenient fiction.
  * This works very well for the stars
  * This works less well for the Moon, the Sun, and the planets, since over the course of months and years, the motions of the Earth and the Moon relative to them cause them to "move around" the celestial sphere
* The two directions along the rotation axis of the celestial sphere are called the "north celestial pole" and "south celestial pole"; the northern one points at the star Polaris.
  * These are **not** north and south; north and south are directions along the surface of the Earth that you can walk in, while the celestial poles lie up in the sky (unless you're on the Equator).
* The stuff in the sky appears to rotate counterclockwise around the NCP and clockwise around the SCP. From Syracuse, some stars, those lying close to the NCP, will be visible all night long;
others will only be visible briefly or not at all (those lying close to the SCP).

### The Sun

* Every day, the Earth rotates once, but it also revolves a little bit -- about one degree -- around the Sun.
* This means that the Earth must rotate **a little bit more** than 360 degrees for the Sun to come back to the same east/west position in the sky (draw a picture).
* This gives us two kinds of day.
* **Sidereal day**: the Earth rotates exactly 360 degrees on its axis. (pronunciation: sid-ee-ree-al, not side-reel)
  * In one sidereal day, the stars come back to the same apparent positions in the sky
  * The Sun doesn't quite make it back, slipping a little bit wastward every sidereal day
* **Solar day**: The Earth rotates 361 degrees on its axis, enough so that the Sun comes back to the same east/west position in the sky.
  * A solar day is about 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day
  * The stars' apparent positions shift a little bit westward every solar day (since it's a bit longer than a sidereal day)
  * We measure days and calibrate our clocks by the solar day, not the sidereal day
* The twelve constellations in the sky that lie behind the Sun as the Earth orbits it are together called the zodiac; which one lies behind the Sun depends on the time of year.

### The Moon

* The Moon goes around the Earth every 28 days, more or less (see "synodic period" vs. "sidereal period", but this won't be on the exam)
* The Moon doesn't give off its own light, but reflects the Sun's light
* This means that half is sunlit and half is dark at any given time
* To figure out the phases of the Moon, draw a picture of the Earth and Moon and Sun, and think of how the Moon looks from Earth.
* To figure out what order the phases go in, and the time that the Moon rises and sets, consider that the Earth rotates counterclockwise and the Moon revolves counterclockwise around it

### The seasons

* The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted by about 23 degrees with respect to its orbit
* This means that people far from the Equator (like we are) are alternatively tilted "toward" or "away" from the Sun
* This causes the seasons in two ways:
  * When we are tilted toward the Sun, we have longer days and shorter nights (summer)
  * When we are tilted toward the Sun, we get more direct sunlight than when we are tilted away
* You should be familiar with the language used to describe this: solstices, equinoxes, etc.
