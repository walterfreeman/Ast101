These notes parallel the <a href="heliocentrism-slides.pdf">slides on heliocentrism</a>. Please jump to slide 6; the earlier material is intro
from last year that is different this year.

Note that this and all slide numbers refer to the numbers at the bottom of each page of the PDF, and *not* the actual PDF page numbers (since 
in my PDF's, transitions are done with a new page in the PDF.)

### Introduction

We find ourselves at the beginning of a new unit, so it's a good time to stop and take stock of what we've studied
and where we are in the story of humanity's discovery of our place among the stars.

We've studied the motion of the stars, the Sun, and the Moon in the night sky, and learned that the apparent 
motion of these things in the night sky is mostly a consequence of Earth's motion: our rotation on our 
(tilted) axis every (sidereal) day, and our orbit around the Sun every year. In doing so, we've casually mixed
together both ancient and modern perspectives. 

While the celestial sphere model is *useful* for predicting the rising and setting of stars, we *now* know that it 
is not literally true -- that is, the stars are not actually rotating around Earth.

However, ancient descriptions of the Solar System took the celestial sphere model literally. They treated the 
Earth as immobile and at the center. All of the planets, the Sun, and the Moon were on different celestial spheres
rotating around Earth at different rates, with the stars together on one sphere.

On slide 8 you can find the modern model along with a medieval European depiction of this model; the artists who created it added things from their religion
to it. (The Latin on the outside translates to something like "Empyrean heaven, home of God and all the saints.")

Our story in Unit 3 is about how this shift in perspective happened: how we learned that the Sun was the center
of the Solar System, and how we invented modern science along the way. Unit 4 concerns the things we discovered
along the way that pioneered the discipline of *physics*.

### Ancient astronomy outside the Middle East and Europe

Ancient cultures had many different astronomical practices, each influenced by their culture and manner of life. 
Remember that people are not that much more intelligent now than they were in the past! (Intelligence has 
improved a little bit with gains in nutrition and medicine: healthier brains work better!) People are clever
now, but they have always been clever, and very good at figuring things out.

Polynesian mariners were experts at navigating by the stars, allowing them to find their way in the Pacific.
Indian and Egyptian astronomers had identified the "precession of the equinoxes" -- the notion that the 
sidereal year (by the constellations and stars) and "tropical year" (by the solstices and equinoxes) were
not the same. Chinese astronomers made exceptionally detailed observations of the supernova in 1066 that has 
since become the Crab Nebula. Structures in Mesoamerica, England, and many other places are aligned exactly with 
position of the Sun at the solstices. Oral tradition from Aboriginal Australians, who personified the stars in
mythology, indicates that they may have known about the pulsation of red-giant stars.

We don't have time to tell all of these stories here, but you can study one of them for your final project if
you like! Instead, we're going to focus on the specific narrative that led to the emergence of modern science:
from Alexandria in northern Egypt, through the Islamic world, to Renaissance Europe.

### Greco-Egyptian civilization and philosophy

We begin our story on the eastern part of the Mediterranean, in the Northern Egyptian city of Alexandria. 
At the time, this city was part of a broader Greco-Egyptian culture and civilization, heavily influenced by
Greek philosophy.

The Greeks held philosophy in tremendous esteem. The word -- *philo-sophia* -- translates to "the love of wisdom".
They had many branches of philosophy, concerned with ethics, politics, and so on, but the one that appears in our
story was *natural philosophy*: the attempt to uncover the truth about the natural world, including the stars and
planets.

Greek philosophy had a couple of properties that made it a powerful tool for exploring nature. Greek thinkers
saw the behavior of the natural world as something we can understand, and 
proposed natural instead of supernatural causes for things. This is essential for learning more about them:
if you attribute plagues to the wrath of God rather than to bacteria and viruses, it's very difficult to 
prevent them!

Greek natural philosophers also made models of nature. This is something we take for granted now, because it 
is a crucial part of the modern scientific method, but it was not always so. A model, here, is a 
simplified mental description of something that is able to predict many or all of its properties. 
These models were often mathematical: the Greeks had a strong tradition of geometry (you've probably heard
of Pythagoras or Euclid...), and they used geometrical reasoning in their models.

They also recognized the need for any model to agree with observations. For instance, they modeled the Earth as 
as a perfect sphere. This is not quite accurate, but it is close! This model agrees with the observation that
the Earth's shadow on the face of the moon during a lunar eclipse is round, and that the Sun will be in 
slightly different places in the sky on the same day at different latitudes. They even used these measurements --
the length of a stick's shadow on the solstice at different places in Egypt -- to calculate the radius of the 
round Earth, even though they had only explored a tiny part of its surface.

However, Greek natural philosophy had some features that were very different from modern science. They took
their veneration of mathematics to the extreme (Pythagoras even led something of a "numbers cult"). They thought
that something that was _mathematically_ beautiful was thus true: for instance, they saw circles and spheres
as mathematically perfect, and so *obviously* motions of things in the sky must be circular, and the Earth
must be a perfect sphere! 

They also saw _detailed observation_ as "lesser than" pure philosophy, which you could do while sitting around and 
drinking wine (you didn't have to stay up until 4AM charting where the planets were). This sort of "grunt work",
of actually measuring things, was seen as the province of mere "astronomy". Astronomy, to the Greeks, was 
concerned with predicting the motions of stars and planets, and _not_ all that concerned with The Search 
For Truth; astronomy was more concerned with "do we get the right answer for where Mars will be next month?"

To us, of course, these are the same: any true model of nature must make accurate predictions, and we search 
for truth by checking observations against the predictions of models. This is the modern scientific approach,
and we will see how it emerges in the next few classes.

### The Ptolemaic geocentric model

The most enduring model of ancient Greco-Egyptian astronomy was Claudius Ptolemy's model of the Solar System.
This name may seem odd to us: "Claudius" is a Greek name, and "Ptolemy" is an old Egyptian pharaonic name taken
from royalty. Our Ptolemy was not royalty, but he lived in northern Egypt.

Let's start by reviewing the observational facts that were known at the time:

* We did not observe parallax in the distant stars. This means that either the stars are extremely far away, or that
the Earth doesn't move.

* Comparing the planets to the background of stars behind them, they mostly move west to east each day, but 
sometimes briefly turn around and move east to west for days or months. This is called "retrograde" motion; 
"retrograde" just means "in the other direction".

Ptolemy was very much on the "astronomy" side of the natural philosophy/astronomy divide. He was concerned about 
predicting motion: "where will Mars be next month?" He constructed a model in which each of the planets, the
Sun, and the Moon are each attached to a celestial sphere surrounding the Earth; all of these rotate at different
rates that are close to, but not quite, one day. All of the distant stars, together, are on a single sphere rotating
exactly once per sidereal day.

This model explains the rising and setting of the stars and Sun and the phases of the Moon. But it _doesn't_ 
predict retrograde motion. In order to get retrograde motion, Ptolemy added "epicycles" -- small loop-the-loops
on top of the larger main orbits of the planets. This is confusing -- see <https://youtu.be/utH-GHH1FT8?t=64> 
for a video. 

This is very complicated, since all of the celestial spheres didn't rotate exactly around Earth, and there were
very many epicycles and other "fudges" to explain the motions of the planets. However -- it **worked!**

If you follow Ptolemy's method, you could predict where the planets would be tomorrow, next month, or even
a thousand years in the future -- to surprisingly good precision!

Ptolemy published all of his methods and tables in a book called the _Almagest_. We don't know its original 
title; this name is Arabic, and means "the greatest"; this is the name given to the book by Arab scholars who
studied it years later.

### Contributions from the Arabic world

Alexandria in Egypt was the center of learning in the Western world
... until it wasn’t.

The great Library at Alexandria was burned (everyone blames everyone else for
this), and Alexandria declined as a center of scholarship.

The Arabs and (later) other Muslim cultures studied the Greek writing, and accumulated a great deal of knowledge
about the motions of the sky; they named many of the stars, refined Ptolemy’s
model, and made enormous strides in mathematics (Arabic numerals, al-jabr
(algebra), etc.) They fixed some of Ptolemy's mathematical mistakes, since their
mathematics extended beyond the Greek geometry that Ptolemy used.

### Meanwhile, in Europe

Europe didn't really have a sophisticated natural-philosophic or astronomical tradition between the fall of the 
Roman Empire and around 1400. Educated Europeans knew about Ptolemy's model, but they mostly just applied it;
they didn't attempt to learn anything further. They were more interested in things like theology and 
applied metallurgy than in science and astronomy. (As an illustration of just how 
invested people at the time were in theology+philosophy, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_filioque_controversy>.) 

### First steps toward heliocentrism

This was the state of affairs until the 1400's, when Europeans found a renewed interest in scholarship and 
ancient philosophy. Ptolemy's geocentric model from the _Almagest_ still worked -- it was off by only a few degrees
after nearly a millenium and a half. But people started to be dissatisfied with it. It was so complicated, and 
epicycles were so inelegant, that people sought another model of the motion of things in the sky that could
explain retrograde motion and everything else without epicycles.

Nicholaus Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed, instead, that the planets and the Earth orbit the Sun, with the Moon
orbiting the Earth. The Earth rotates once a day. (See figure on slide 26. The Latin here gives the time it takes for each of these objects to go around the Sun (for instance, Saturn is 30 years; Jupiter is 12), and they
are basically correct.)

This sort of model is called "heliocentric", from Greek "Helios" (Sun) + center.

Here, retrograde motion is explained by the _relative_ motion of Earth and the other planet. Copernicus' insight was that nothing needed to travel
backwards to give retrograde motion of (say) Mars; the only thing that we need is for both Mars _and_ the Earth to move.

Imagine that you are in a car driving around a circular race track, and another car is also driving around the same track with you, but moving more slowly. Most of the time, it appears to travel forwards -- you look across to the other side of the track and see the car driving over there. But, when you are right next to that car and are passing it, it appears to be moving _backwards_ to you. 

This is it, right? We've solved the puzzle! We now have a model that predicts the things we see:

* The rotation of Earth (every 24 hours) explains the rising and setting of things in the sky, including the stars
* The orbit of the Moon around the Earth explains the phases of the Moon
* The orbit of the Earth around the Sun explains why the Sun isn't always in the same constellation
* The orbits of the planets around the Sun, along with the Earth's motion, explain why they show retrograde motion

So we're done! This is the modern perspective, right?

... nope.

### The Problem with Copernicus' Model

The Copernican model gets these big-picture ideas right, but it doesn't actually give very accurate predictions about _where the planets will be_. If you
try to use the Copernican model to calculate anything with precision, it is obviously off.

### A Quirky Preface

Copernicus' publisher added a preface to his book which seems very unusual to us. Translated into modern English it reads:

*“This is unusual. But it is just mathematics; it should be judged on
whether or not it makes accurate predictions; this is separate from
whether it contains actual philosophical truth!”*

This seems odd to us, since we expect things that are true to also be accurate. But, at the time, the publisher presented this as
only a mathematical toy, a tool for calculating, but not an actual accurate description of the world.

### The Galileo Affair

We are now in a situation where we have a model that predicts retrograde motion and everything else simply, but is incorrect in its details.

Galileo Galilei lived around a hundred years after Copernicus. He knew of Copernicus' work and was a strong supporter. He was one of the pioneers
of the scientific method, and did many experiments in different areas of physics. In astronomy, he is best known as the first person to apply the 
telescope to astronomy.

The telescope had recently been invented in the Netherlands (around 1607). It was useful to Dutch sailors. But Galileo realized that the telescope had
applications to astronomy, made improvements on the Dutch designs, and turned it to the sky.

He saw three things that started a revolution:

* Four little moons orbiting Jupiter, going around every day or so
* Phases (crescent/half/gibbous/full) of Venus, just like the Moon, in a pattern that can only be explained in a heliocentric model
* Craters and mountains, and their shadows, on the surface of the Moon

These things provided strong evidence that Copernicus was right, at least in the broad structure. The moons of Jupiter prove that not everything orbits the 
Sun, and the phases of Venus are strong evidence that both Earth and Venus orbit the Sun, rather than both the Sun and Venus orbiting Earth.

Mountains on the Moon don't seem like such a big deal. But the Catholic Church had taught that everything in the sky (including the Moon) was perfectly
round, and the observation of shadows from terrain on the Moon showed that this couldn't be the case.

Galileo published these findings in 1610, arguing that this proved that the Earth moved around the Sun. Now he has stopped merely doing astronomy
(predicting where things are) and entered *philosophy* -- the truth of things.

Recently, something else happened in Europe: the Protestant Reformation, where a priest named Martin Luther started a movement to protest against what he
saw as corruption and abuse in the Catholic Church. This was a challenge to the political authority of the Pope, and so the Church started a movement
called the Counter-Reformation that tried to capture Protestants and extinguish their doctrines. (The Inquisition that you may have read about was 
very active in this era.) So the Chruch was quite touchy about heresy at the time. ("Heresy" means "believing or teaching something opposed to 
someone's religion".)

In 1616 they proclaimed heliocentrism to be heresy. But Galileo continued to be convinced by the evidence. In 1632 he published a book
titled _Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems_, comparing heliocentrism and geocentrism in a mock "debate" in which the geocentrist came off
looking quite stupid.

In 1633 the Church banned all of Galileo's books and declared him a heretic, and the Inquisition captured him and put him on trial for heresy. They 
sentenced him to house arrest; he couldn't leave his home until he died in 1642.

### Ramifications of Galileo's work

This work reunified the separate disciplines of astronomy ("Where will Mars be next month and what will it look like?") and natural philosophy 
("What is the true nature of the movements of Mars and Earth?") Galileo made detailed observations with the telescope, and _by_ making these observations,
determined the truth about the Solar System.

### But there's still a problem!

Galileo, for all his work with the telescope, still had no better model than Copernicus'. Recall that, while it predicted a lot of things that Galileo
saw (like the phases of Venus), it is not that accurate -- nowhere near as accurate as Ptolemy's 1500-year-old geocentric model. 

Can we do better?

In class, I was going to put up a multiple-choice question asking how to proceed. The choices were:

* A: Doublecheck Copernicus’ math, to see if his circles could be realigned to get better results
* B: Make the most precise measurements of the planets that you can
* C: Find other heliocentric models besides the one Copernicus had
* D: Stick the Galilean moons around Jupiter in the Ptolemaic model and accept it as true

(D), here, sounds like giving up. But it turns out that we did all three of the others.

B: Someone made astoundingly precise measurements of the motions of the planets...
A: They then tried to see if they could make Copernicus' model fit them ...

... and, after failing to do so, they...

C: Introduced a new heliocentric model.

We'll get to that story Tuesday!
