1. B; each element leaves its fingerprint in the absorption lines. Fewer lines mean fewer elements.
2. D
3. C
4. A; all that matters is the peak wavelength.
5. B; you know it's red-orange since the Sun is well-balanced across the visible spectrum, and this bulb is cooler than that.
6. D; 3 Kelvin is very cold so the thermal radiation corresponding to it will be very long wavelength.
7. B
8. A; look at all six possible transitions and figure out their energies.
9. A
10. A
11. D; this is the "sunium" of our question in class, as we discussed
12. B. Only the red ones are actually *neon* lights; the rest are other gases!
13. D
14. B; for Star II to be brighter than Star I despite the fact that it is cooler, it must be larger.
15. B. Gravitational waves were covered last year but not this year and will not be on the exam.
16. C
17. D
18. A. Any transit through a lot of gas produces absorption lines, not just the Sun's atmosphere. (There was a LT question about this.)
19. E. You and the snowman both have a temperature and both emit thermal radiation; you are slightly warmer (300 K instead of 273 K) and so you are a bit brighter and emit shorter-wavelength IR.
20. D. More visible light!
21. C. All you can tell from the color is the temperature.
22. A. Neutrinos barely interact! (We get this many neutrinos from the Sun and we don't notice them.)
23. C
24. C
25. E; both (B) and (D) are false.
26. E. It is tempting to choose curve (4) since it peaks at the longest wavelengths, but note that it *still* contains a significant amount of visible light. People don't
appear to glow at all in the visible, so the actual thermal-radiation curve must be even longer-wavelength than these.
27. A. The dark lines don't affect the apparent color of the Sun much since they are very narrow.
28. A. Hydrogen is the Sun's fusion fuel!
29. C
30. C. (This is a quantitative description of what is going on in problem 2.
