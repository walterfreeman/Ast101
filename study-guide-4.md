# Study guide for Unit 4

In this unit, we studied:

* The history of the Solar System and its basic structure
* Why the inner planets and the outer planets are different
* Why the inner planets differ from each other
* The physics of the greenhouse effect
* The history of Earth's climate and the science of climate change 
* The history and physics of rocketry and spaceflight
* The technical challenges in future of humans as a spacefaring species
* Extraterrestrial life

### The history of the Solar System

* The Solar System coalesced out of a nebula of gas and dust, formed billions of years ago out of hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang, and a few heavier elements forged
in earlier stars that exploded in supernovae
* Gravity pulled this material inward; its rotation accelerated and it flattened out into a disk
* Most of the material fell into the center and became the Sun
* Small bits of dust stuck together on the outside, first by static electricity and then by gravity; these "planetesimals" stuck together and eventually formed the planets; planetesimals that never merged into the large planets became moons, comets, and asteroids.
* Over time the planets cooled and solidified, losing the heat that they acquired during their collapse
* As the Sun grew larger, eventually the pressure at the center was sufficient to kindle nuclear fusion
* The solar wind swept away the remnant gas and dust. This process was complete around 4.5 billion years ago.

### Radioactive dating

* Certain rocks can form only with certain elements, but not others. For instance, zircons form with uranium inside
them, but not lead.
* Radioactive elements decay at predictable rates. For instance, the half-life of uranium-235 is around 700 million
years.
* By studying the ratio of uranium-235 to lead in a zircon crystal, we can determine how long ago it formed.
  * If it has an equal number of uranium atoms and lead atoms, we know it is one half-life old
  * If it has three times as many lead atoms as uranium atoms, we know that only one-fourth of the uranium is left,
    and thus it is two half-lives old
* This process allows us to determine how old the Earth is
* Dating with multiple different methods (uranium/lead and potassium/argon) gives an age of the oldest rocks on Earth
  around 4.3-4.5 billion years.
* We've done this to lower precision on Mars, and it is about the same age.
* The oldest meteorites are a little bit older, maybe 4.55 billion years.

### The nature of the planets

* Liquid water can't condense into a planet. Ice, however, can.
* This means that we expect to see planets made of frozen ice, methane, ammonia, and the like where it is cold enough for them to freeze: Jupiter and further out
* The inner planets (Mars and inward) are too hot for this to happen, so they are only made of metal and rock, which solidify at much higher temperaturse
* The outer planets grew much larger, large enough for their gravity to hold in hydrogen and helium in their atmospheres ("gas giants")

### The inner planets: atmospheres

* Mercury is a dead rock and has no atmosphere
* Mars once had a significant atmosphere, but something changed three billion years ago -- probably related to the end of significant seismic activity -- and it lost most of its atmosphere
* Earth has a moderate atmosphere; its greenhouse effect warms Earth by about 30C
* Venus has a thick atmosphere of mostly CO2; its greenhouse effect warms it by about 400C into the toxic lead-melting hellscape that it is today

### The greenhouse effect

* Stars, being hot, emit thermal radiation in the visible range
* Planets heat up to whatever temperature is necessary for their thermal radiation to carry away the incoming sunlight
* This is around a few hundred Kelvin $\rightarrow$ infrared radiation.
* Many atmospheric gases, like carbon dioxide, methane, and water, block infrared radiation but allow visible light to pass through
* This makes it harder for the outgoing IR radiation from the planet to escape, and causes the planet to be hotter than it otherwise would

### Earth's climate

* The levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and water in the Earth's atmosphere control the strength of its greenhouse effect and thus its temperature
* There have been natural variations in the levels of these gases, caused by the slow drift of feedback loops and geological activity over many millions of years
* These variations are responsible for the changes in the climate since the age of the dinosaurs; the climate then was about 10C warmer than now
* During the last million years or so we've seen a cycle of ice ages, initially caused by orbital cycles but amplified by feedback with the greenhouse effect; the difference between an ice age and the present climate is about 5C
* Atmospheric CO2 closely tracks the historical temperature of the Earth
* 55 million years ago there was a sudden release of CO2, similar to what we're doing today
* It caused the earth to warm by around 5C for thousands to tens of thousands of years, causing major changes in the life patterns of plants and animals
* Recently humans have greatly increased the level of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere to levels that haven't been seen for millions of years
* This has already caused the earth to warm by about 1C
* This warming effect is amplified in the Arctic due to the feedback between melting ice and the increased absorption of sunlight
* This will change local climate patterns and cause sea levels to rise, greatly disrupting life for many people and ecological communities
* Warming of about 2C is likely to happen no matter what
* Depending on how quickly we act to mitigate CO2 emissions, we may be in store for warming of up to 5-7C over the next century
* The overwhelming scientific consensus supports this picture; the only serious dispute is in the details.

### Spaceflight

* Rockets work by Newton's third law: push on exhaust gases going backwards, they push on you going forwards
* For a given exhaust velocity, the size of the rocket you need increases **exponentially** as the amount of "kick" you need increases
* For a given amount of "kick", the size of the rocket you need decreases **exponentially** as the exhaust velocity of the gas increases
* Thus, the greatest possible improvement in rocketry comes from increasing the speed of the exhaust -- this is crucial
* Timeline:
  * First serious proposals for spaceflight came in 1850's (Jules Verne, in fiction)
  * Tsiolkovsky figured out the mathematics of rockets around 1900
  * Goddard made rockets practical in the 1920's
  * Rockets refined as a weapon of war in the 1940's (WWII)
  * The US and the Soviets competed in the "space race" as a proxy for showing off technology that could be used to make nuclear-armed missiles
  * The US worked to send a person to the Moon in the 1960's, and succeeded in 1969
  * Since then we've sent robots to the planets and out of the Solar System, but people only to low-earth orbit in the Space Shuttle
* We currently have all the scientific knowledge we need to send humans to Mars; we just need the political will to do it
* The biggest problem in human spaceflight is keeping the humans alive, warm, fed, etc., and bringing them home
* Human spaceflight is expensive, but not as expensive as some other things that we do; it's a question of priorities and economics

### Exobiology

* Life on Earth relies on the availability of carbon compounds and liquid water
* Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are reasonably common in the universe (they're made in stars like all heavy elements, but aren't that heavy)
* These carbon compounds are found in deep space, so the "ingredients" for life aren't all that rare
* Earth-like life, then, could be found anywhere between 273K and 373K where there is water
* Early Mars has water, and it might have had enough of a greenhouse effect or seismic activity to have pockets that were warm enough
* Titan (Saturnian moon) or the moons of Jupiter? They're kept warm by seismic activity
* Planets around other stars? Our solar system is not special...
* Encouraging feature: life on Earth developed very quickly (but took billions of years to evolve intelligence)
* The Drake Equation: the number of civilizations we can talk to is the product of:
  * Rate of star formation
  * Fraction of those that have planets
  * Number of planets that **can** support life per star
  * Fraction on which intelligence evolves
  * Fraction of those that develop radio technology or some other communications tech
  * The length of time that each survives for
* Huge uncertainties in this, but it's a framework to think about the factors involved
* The Fermi paradox: we exist, but where is everyone else?

### Humans as a spacefaring civilization

* The biggest challenge: dealing with the long travel times
* Mission to Alpha Centauri: 50-100 years minimum (one-way)
* Communication delay: 4 years one way
* This is not a "go there, watch it on the BBC, come back" sort of mission
* When we commit to the stars, we're committing to people who live and die in space (or cryogenics)
* Any interstellar civilization has to be spread-out in time, as well as space
