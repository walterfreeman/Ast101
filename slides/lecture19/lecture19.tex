If you smash hydrogen nuclei together hard enough, they fuse to make helium
 -- plus two neutrinos -- plus a {\it lot} of energy.

$$(P) + (P) + (P) + (P) \rightarrow (NNPP) + 2e^+ + 2\nu$$

How much energy? We can calculate it...

We can calculate how much energy is associated with nuclear fusion by looking at how much potential energy
there is.

\item When the Sun runs out of hydrogen in its core, the core contracts,
while the outer layers puff up: it becomes a {\color{Red}red giant}. 
(5 billion years in the future, lasting for 1 billion years)

\item Eventually the core gets hot enough to fuse helium
into carbon, and the 
core ignites in a ``helium flash''. 

\item When the helium is depleted, that's it: the Sun isn't heavy enough
to fuse carbon.

\item The carbon core will be left behind as a white dwarf, slowly cooling
-- a dying ember in the sky, called a brown/black dwarf.

\item Its outer layers will be blown out into interstellar space,
briefly forming a nebula.

More massive stars have enough weight to compress their carbon cores and fuse it to (mostly) Ne, Na, Mg, and O. 

\BS

This process releases less energy than even helium fusion, so it doesn't last as long.

\BS

Elements fuse into heavier and heavier elements, releasing less energy each time, until they reach iron in the 
heaviest stars.

\BS

Iron is ``stellar ash'' -- it can't release any more energy by fusion.

\BS 

In some of these heaviest stars, once their iron cores grow too much, 
gravity crushes them into one enormous atomic nucleus -- a neutron star.

The resulting explosion destroys the rest of the star.

\BS

It causes a flurry of nuclear reactions, forging elements heavier than iron.

\BS

It also scatters the heavy-element-rich contents of the star out to space.
This is why the Earth has so much iron in it -- and where our heavy elements come from.

\BS

It releases massive amounts of energy, forming a bright flash in the sky.

\BS

This is the Crab Nebula, the remnant of the 1054 supernova.

\BS

It was hundreds of times further away than most visible stars, but could be seen even during the day!
