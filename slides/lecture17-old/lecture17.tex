\frame{\frametitle{\bf Emission spectra}

Last time we saw that atoms can emit light of particular wavelengths/energies corresponding to their atomic transitions.

\BS

This gives us {\it emission spectra} consisting of bright lines (from NMSU Astronomy):

\EC

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Absorption spectra}

\large

Elements can also {\it absorb} wavelengths of these particular wavelengths as well.

\BS

(Remember that these atomic transitions can go both ways.)

\BS

Other colors simply pass through.

\BS

(Molecules have these spectra too: their electron energy levels are more complicated.)

You discover lines in the solar spectrum that don't correspond to any known element.
What do you conclude?

\BS

\color{A}A: Something about quantum mechanics is different in the Sun\\\BS

\color{B}B: Something about light is different in the Sun\\\BS
\color{C}C: There's an element in the Sun that's not on Earth -- call it {\bf sunium} \\ \BS
\color{D}D: The extreme temperature of the Sun causes new lines to appear in its gas \\ \BS
\pause
\color{E}E: ``Sunium''? There's no such element!

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf What a lucky accident!}
\large 
We're very lucky that atomic transitions happen to lie in our visual range!

There are others that are very interesting to astronomers:

\BI
\item Molecular vibrations: infrared
\pause
\item Molecular {\it rotations}: microwave
\pause
\item ``Hyperfine structure'' energy levels in hydrogen: 21 cm radio waves
\EI

\pause

\normalsize

This last is particularly interesting: it is a very particular frequency, echoing out from
all corners of the Universe, that says: hydrogen is here. (Hydrogen is 75\% of the universe.)

Let's look at that solar spectrum again:

\BS
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{solarspectrum.jpg}

\BS

We understand why the dark lines are where they are. But where does that continuous spectrum -- light of {\it all} wavelengths -- come from
in the first place?

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Thermal radiation}}

\BC
\Large
Objects glow because they're hot.
\EC
\BS
\BS

\BI
\item Any object with a temperature emits electromagnetic radiation (``light'').
\item For objects as warm as we are, this is in the ``far infrared''.
\item As objects heat up, the peak wavelength decreases (the average photon energy increases)
\item As objects heat up, the total intensity emitted goes up {\it rapidly} (proportional to $T^4$)
\item This is also called ``blackbody radiation'' (since even a black object glows if it's warmed up)

See the simulation to see how this works...
