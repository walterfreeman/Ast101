O Fortune, like the Moon you are changeable, 
ever waxing and waning; hateful life 
first oppresses and then soothes
as fancy takes it; poverty and power,
it melts them like ice.

O Fortuna, velut Luna, statu variabilis,

From {\it Carmina Burana}, a $13^{\rm th}$-century manuscript found in an abbey south of Munich. This manuscript contained poetry written in Latin and German by
clergy in their off-duty hours, when they were decidedly not being holy!

\bigskip 

Set to music by Carl Orff (1937).

\bigskip

Other movements talk about springtime, sexuality, satire of the corrupt, drunkenness, and more sexuality;
the work both opens and closes with this movement.

What if the Earth's axial tilt were increased to $30^\circ$ from $23^\circ$?

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Taking stock}}

We now understand the motion of the stars, and the combined effects of the Earth's axial tilt, rotation, and orbit have on the seasons.

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The phases of the Moon}}

\large

As in {\it O Fortuna}, the Moon has often been a symbol of change.

\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

That change is regular, though: every 29.5 days, the pattern of phases repeats.

\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

This is orderly enough that it is the basis of many calendars:

\BI
\item{Hebrew calendar}
\item{Traditional Chinese calendar}
\item{Babylonian calendar}
\EI

\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

... but not the traditional calendars of Europe. (Why might that be?)

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The phases of the Moon}}

\large

Everything else in the sky seems to be a constant size and shape, but the Moon waxes and wanes. Why?

\pause
\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

The Moon differs from the stars in that {\color{Red}it doesn't make its own light}.

\bigskip

It orbits the Earth 400,000 km (1/500 AU!) away, once every 29 days or so, orbiting counterclockwise when looking down at the North Pole.

\bigskip

What consequences does this have?

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The phases of the Moon}}

\Huge

Which is true?

\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

\large

\color{A}A: The phases of the Moon happen because the Moon's motion around the Earth causes it to receive different amounts of light from the Sun, varying from completely
lit (full moon) to not lit at all (new moon) \\

\bigskip

\color{B}B: The phases of the Moon happen because half of the Moon is always lit by the Sun, but our perspective changes how much of that half we see \\

\bigskip

\color{C}C: The phases of the Moon happen because the Earth blocks part of the light from the Sun, resulting in a shadow on the Moon's face \\

\bigskip

\color{D}D: The phases of the Moon happen because the Earth moves around the Moon each day, and we see a different part of the Moon \\
