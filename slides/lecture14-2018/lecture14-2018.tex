``[T]he imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man (sic). For instance, how much more remarkable it is for us to be stuck -- half of us upside down -- by a mysterious attraction, to a spinning ball that has been swinging in space for billions of years, than to be carried on the back of an elephant supported on a tortoise swimming in a bottomless sea.

\bigskip

For instance, I stand at the seashore, alone, and start to think.

\smallskip

There are the rushing waves, mountains of molecules, each stupidly minding its own business, trillions apart, yet forming white surf in unison.

\smallskip


Ages on ages, before any eyes could see, year after year, thunderously pounding the shore as now.

\smallskip


For whom, for what? On a dead planet, with no life to entertain.

\smallskip


Never at rest,  tortured by energy, wasted prodigiously by the sun, poured into space. A mite makes the sea roar.


\smallskip

Deep in the sea, all molecules repeat the patterns of one another till complex new ones are formed. They make others like themselves, and a new dance starts.

\smallskip


Growing in size and complexity: living things, masses of atoms, DNA, protein... dancing a pattern ever more intricate.

\medskip


Out of the cradle onto the dry land, here it is standing: atoms with consciousness,  matter with curiosity.

\smallskip


Stands at the sea, wonders at wondering: I, a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe.''

The discoveries of Kepler, Galileo, and Newton did more than explain the solar system.

\bigskip

They merged disciplines that had been separate since the time of the Greeks:

\BI
\item Natural philosophy: ``what is the truth of Nature?'' (truth-seeking)
\item Astronomy: ``Where can I find Mars next week?'' (practical applications)
\EI

\bigskip
Newton brought us into the age of {\it astrophysics} -- possibly the first true {\it science}. What's that mean?

\pause

\BI
\item Truth in precision
\item Synergy between truth-seeking and practical observation
\item Synergy between theory and experiment
\BI
\item Theory: ``Use things we've already observed to design a model''
\item Exp't: ``Carefully choose observations to make to inform/test models''
\EI

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The scientific method}}

\item Partial agreement: can we refine the model? (Copernicus)

What things do scientific explanations have in common?

\bigskip \pause

\item Scientific explanations are {\color{Red}not anthropocentric} -- they don't give humans (or Earth) a special role
\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The natural worldview}}
\Large
Science doesn't attempt to answer everything, only:

\BI
\item ... what is the Universe made of?
\item ... how does it work?
\item Questions like: ``if I do this, what will happen?''
\EI

\bigskip\pause

It doesn't address questions like...

\BI
\item ``What {\it should} we do here?''
\item ``What does it mean to be a good person?''
\pause
\item ``How should we imagine our place in the world?''
\EI

\bigskip\pause

The natural, non-anthropocentric view {\it does} influence our outlook, though...}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Scientific integrity}}
\large
``But this long history of learning how not to fool ourselves--of
having utter scientific integrity--is, I'm sorry to say, something
that we haven't specifically included in any particular course that
I know of. We just hope you've caught on by osmosis.

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself--and you are
the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about
that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other
scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after
that.

\medskip
\BC ... \EC
\medskip

I'm talking about
a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending
over backwards to show how you are maybe wrong, that you ought to
have when acting as a scientist.

\medskip
\BC ... \EC
\medskip

One example of the principle is this: If you've made up your mind
to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should
always decide to publish it whichever way it comes out. If we only
publish results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look
good. We must publish both kinds of results.''

There's an entire discipline of mathematics designed to, in an objective way, examine what results mean: {\color{Red} statistics.}

``Our time is distinguished by wonderful achievements in the fields of scientific understanding and the technical application of those insights. Who would not be cheered by this? But let us not forget that human knowledge and skills alone cannot lead humanity to a happy and dignified life. Humanity has every reason to place the proclaimers of high moral standards and values above the discoverers of objective truth. What humanity owes to personalities like Buddha, Moses, and Jesus ranks for me higher than all the achievements of the enquiring and constructive mind.
What [they] have given us we must guard and try to keep alive with all our strength if humanity is not to lose its dignity, the security of its existence, and its joy in living.''

\frame{\frametitle{\bf{An illuminating story}}

In the late 19th century, the laws of electromagnetism looked like this:

\BI
\item Electric fields exert a force on electric charges
\item Magnetic fields exert a force on {\it moving} electric charges
\EI

\bigskip

We know this thanks in large part to the work of Michael Faraday, who
famously wasn't good at algebra and drew pictures of fields.

\bigskip

Where do these fields come from?

\BI
\item Electric charges make electric fields
\item Moving electric charges make magnetic fields
\item Changing magnetic fields make electric fields
\pause
\item {\color{Red} Changing electric fields make magnetic fields}
\EI

\item Electric charges make electric fields
\item Moving electric charges make magnetic fields
\item Changing magnetic fields make electric fields
\item {\color{Red} Changing electric fields make magnetic fields}

\BS

Last law added by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860's, and it has
a surprising consequence:

\BS
\BI
\item{Changing electric field makes a magnetic field}
\pause \item ... which makes a magnetic field ...
\pause \item ... which makes an electric field further away ...
\pause \item This leads to a traveling electromagnetic disturbance: an {\it electromagnetic wave}.
\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\bf{An illuminating story}}

Maxwell calculated that these electromagnetic waves traveled at
around 300 million meters per second.

\BS

Independently, light had been measured to travel at 300 million
meters per second some years prior.

\BS \pause

So ... if this electromagnetic wave travels at the speed of
light, perhaps it {\it is} light?

\BS

In the history of science, sometimes theory gets ahead of experiment -- like in the discovery of the nature of light.
