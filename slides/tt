``[T]he imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man (sic). For instance, how much more remarkable it is for us to be stuck -- half of us upside down -- by a mysterious attraction, to a spinning ball that has been swinging in space for billions of years, than to be carried on the back of an elephant supported on a tortoise swimming in a bottomless sea.

\bigskip

For instance, I stand at the seashore, alone, and start to think. 

\smallskip

There are the rushing waves, mountains of molecules, each stupidly minding its own business, trillions apart, yet forming white surf in unison.

\smallskip


Ages on ages, before any eyes could see, year after year, thunderously pounding the shore as now. 

\smallskip


For whom, for what? On a dead planet, with no life to entertain.

\smallskip


Never at rest,  tortured by energy, wasted prodigiously by the sun, poured into space. A mite makes the sea roar.


\smallskip

Deep in the sea, all molecules repeat the patterns of one another till complex new ones are formed. They make others like themselves, and a new dance starts.

\smallskip


Growing in size and complexity: living things, masses of atoms, DNA, protein... dancing a pattern ever more intricate.

\medskip


Out of the cradle onto the dry land, here it is standing: atoms with consciousness,  matter with curiosity.

\smallskip


Stands at the sea, wonders at wondering: I, a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe.''
