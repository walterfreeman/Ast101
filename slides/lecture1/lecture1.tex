The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. 
Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. 
In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. 
And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. 
In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, 
explorations that are exhilarating to consider. 
They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, 
that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. 

\BS

I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.

We set up a Discord server last year during the pandemic to help students find community while stuck at home during the pandemic.

It was a great success, so we want to keep the tradition alive.

Using it isn't required for class, but we hope it'll be a helpful resource (and fun place) for people who want to use it.

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Three measures of distance...}}
\Large
Inside the Solar System, it's also useful to measure distances with a different yardstick:
the distance to the Sun. This is called an {\color{Red}astronomical unit}, or AU.

\bigskip

We have:

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item{1 kilometer}
\BI
\item{(good for measuring Earth-size things)}
\EI
\item{1 AU = 150 million km ($1.5 \times 10^8$ km) = about 9 light-minutes}
\BI
\item{(good for measuring distances to the planets)}
\EI
\item{1 light-year = 60,000 AU = 9 trillion km ($9 \times 10^{12}$ km)}
\pause
\item{1 universe = 14 billion light-years!}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf {Takeaways: size and scale}}

\large

\BI
\item Inner planets like Earth are about 10,000 km across
\item The Moon is around 400,000 km from Earth
\item The inner planets are hundreds of millions of km -- around an AU -- away from the Sun
\item Outer planets like Jupiter are about 100,000 km across and tens of AU from the Sun
\item The nearest star is around 250,000 AU (4 ly) from us
\EI

\BS
\BS

We tend to usually use AU to measure things in this class, since we are mostly concerned with the Solar System.

\BS

We don't expect you to memorize exact numbers, but you should have a general idea of the scale of things near us in the Universe.

This is a computer simulation of a collision that will happen in a few billion years.

Using a few principles you'll learn about in this class, and a computer, you can make this!

We, on our little rock, can actually {\it understand} how this all works!
