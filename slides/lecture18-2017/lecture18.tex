If I take hydrogen and tear the electrons off of the atoms with an electric current,
they'll ``fall'' back down, going through the energy levels down to $n=1$.

\BS

Sometimes they'll skip energy levels; sometimes they'll go in sequence.

\BS

If I do this to hydrogen, what color will we see?

\BS
\BS

\color{A}A: UV: we won't see it, since the transitions down to $n=1$ are in the UV\\

\BS

\color{B}B: Several shades of red: we'll see the transitions down to $n=2$, which are red\\ 

\BS

\color{C}C: Infrared: the transitions at the top are very low energy, corresponding to
infrared light which we can't see \\ 

\BS

\color{D}D: UV, IR, and red, all at once: all the transitions happen, but we only see the
red photons because of the limits of our eyes\\ 

\BS

\pause

\color{E}E: Orange, because this is Syracuse, darnit!

\large

Every chemical element has a unique {\it spectrum}: the colors of light that it can emit and absorb.

\BS

Other colors simply pass through.

\BS

(Molecules have these spectra too: their electron energy levels are more complicated.)

You discover lines in the solar spectrum that don't correspond to any known element.

\item ``Hyperfine structure'' energy levels in hydrogen: 21 cm radio waves

This last is particularly interesting: it is a very particular frequency, echoing out from
all corners of the Universe, that says: hydrogen is here. (Hydrogen is 75\% of the universe.)

If you smash hydrogen nuclei together hard enough, they fuse to make helium
 -- plus two neutrinos -- plus a {\it lot} of energy.

\BS

$$(P) + (P) + (P) + (P) \rightarrow (NNPP) + 2e^+ + 2\nu$$

How much energy? Let's calculate it!

This {\color{Red} nuclear fusion} process converts hydrogen fuel into 
helium and a vast amount of energy. Could we harness it here on Earth?

\item When the Sun runs out of hydrogen in its core, the core contracts,
while the outer layers puff up: it becomes a {\color{Red}red giant}. 
(5 billion years in the future, lasting for 1 billion years)

\item Eventually the core gets hot enough to fuse helium
into carbon, and the 
core ignites in a ``helium flash''. 

\item When the helium is depleted, that's it: the Sun isn't heavy enough
to fuse carbon

\item The carbon core will be left behind as a white dwarf, slowly cooling
-- a dying ember in the sky.

\item Its outer layers will be blown out into interstellar space,
briefly forming a nebula
