Maybe our data are wrong...

The measurements of the sky that people had been using were ``good enough'' for navigation, but
they weren't ever intended for precision natural philosophy: determining the truth of things...

you have to think carefully about this!)

\begin{enumerate}

\item The planets move in {\it ellipses}, with the Sun at one focus

\bigskip
\bigskip

\item The line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times \\
Alternate formulation: Within its orbit, a planet's speed is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun
\bigskip
\bigskip

\item The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse.
\bigskip
\bigskip

\end{enumerate}


Let's talk about each of these in turn.
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Kepler's first law}}
\large
An ellipse is just a stretched circle. Mathematically: it's the curve around two points such that the {\it sum} of the distances to 
those points is a constant. A circle is just an ellipse with both foci at the same point.

\BC
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ellipse.png}

\item{Semimajor axis: the largest distance from the center to the edge}
\item{Eccentricity: how stretched out an ellipse is}

Comets have highly eccentric orbits. Halley's Comet's furthest point from the Sun -- its {\it aphelion} -- is 35 AU away.
But its {\it perihelion} -- the nearest point to the Sun -- is 0.6 AU away.

Kepler's third law of orbital motion says that the square of a planet's {\it orbital period} is proportional
to the cube of its {\it semimajor axis}.

Simply put: if a planet is further from the Sun, it takes longer to go around.
