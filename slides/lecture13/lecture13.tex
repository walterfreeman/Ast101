\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The nature of science}}

\large

In this unit we have taken a look at a series of revolutions that showed us the true nature of the solar system.

\bigskip

But they also merged disciplines that had been separate since the time of the Greeks:

\BI
\item Natural philosophy: ``what is the truth of Nature?'' (truth-seeking)
\item Astronomy: ``Where can I find Mars next week?'' (practical applications)
\EI

\bigskip
Newton brought us into the age of {\it astrophysics} -- possibly the first true {\it science}. What's that mean?

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The scientific method}}
\Large
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``Huh, that is interesting -- I wonder how it works?''
\item Develop a {\it model}: a picture that explains as much as you can
\item Compare the predictions of your model to real-world observations
\pause
\BI
\item Partial agreement: can we refine the model? (Copernicus)
\item Complete disagreement: Tear it up and go back to (1)
\EI
\item Model agrees with observations so far: It's a useful {\it theory}
\pause
\item Does the model predict new things not yet observed?
\item Design observations to test for them (experiments!)
\BI
\item Partial agreement: can we refine the model?
\item Complete disagreement: Tear it up and go back to (1)
\EI

\item Body of supporting evidence grows
\item Continually seek to expand the {\it scope} of the model with more observations

	\item \large {\bf Universality:} the laws of nature apply in all places and times, and to all things (including humans)
	\item \normalsize Since the laws of nature are universal, they form a coherent whole
	\item \normalsize Any new finding must find its place alongsid preexisting measurements and principles
	\item \normalsize Very rarely previously-accepted things get overturned; more often they are {\it extended} 
	
	\pause
	
	\BS
	\color{D}
	\item \large {\bf Objectivity:} scientific ideas, or the evaluation of them, should be independent of any particular human perspective
	\item \normalsize Science is not about {\it you} (whoever you are)
	\item \normalsize Criticism of other people's ideas isn't about them, either

	Science -- as a means of seeking truth -- has a few fundamental properties:

	\item \normalsize This is different from the old Greek natural philosophy, that valued {\it pure thought} over the dirty work of {\it measuring things}
	
	\BS
	\BS
	\color{B}

	We've discussed some of the common features of people {\it advancing scientific claims}
	incorrectly, negligently, or dishonestly.
	
	\BS

	Sometimes dishonest people aren't trying to {\it advance} something they know to be false, though.
	
	\BS
	
	They're more interested in convincing people to {\it reject} something that is true.
	
	\BS
	
	To do that, they only need to create doubt. This is commonly done by {\it manufacturing a controversy}.

	Do you have any favorite examples of manufactured controversies?
	\EC
	
	\pause
	
	Consider again the tobacco industry:
	
	\BI
	\item ``Secondhand smoke doesn't cause health problems; those studies are wrong''
	\item ``Are you really sure that secondhand smoke causes health problems? Maybe it was building ventilation!''
	\EI
	
	One of these is a far easier sell than the other!
	
	\BS
	\BS
	\normalsize
	{\it The industry's strategy does not require winning the debates it manufactures. It is enough to foster and perpetuate the illusion of controversy in order to muddy the waters around scientific findings that threaten the industry. Thus it offers reassurance to smokers, helping them to rationalize and repress their health concerns. Furthermore, claims of ``not proven'' resonate with friendly or naive journalists and governments, and provide an excuse for not taking strong governmental or societal action against tobacco.}

	Two things are both true:
	
	\BI
	\item Some scientific findings can dramatically change our lives and our perspective on the world, and are compelling and exciting
	\item Whether a scientific claim is true or not doesn't depend on whether it's exciting or not (objectivity)
	\EI
	
	\BS\BS
	
	Scientists thus have twin duties:
	
	\BI
	\item They should engage with society in sharing the excitement and interest of their findings. Science communication is vital (and many of us are bad at it; the astronomers do better than the physicists!)
	\item They should {\color{Red} separate this excitement} from the task of {\color{Green} evaluating the validity of claims}
	\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Sensationalism}}
	\large
	Beware of any sort of scientific claim that conflates {\color{Red}the evidence that it is true} with {\color{Green}why you should be excited by it}, or that seems to be {\color{D}hyped by its claimant}.
	
	\BS
	\BS
	
	Good scientists do hold press conferences, because many discoveries are exciting!
	
	\BS
	
	But these happen only in the context of:
	
	\BI
	\item a vast amount of self-skepticism applied to their results first
	\item objective, sober presentation of the {\it evidence} for their conclusions
	\EI

Often people adopt the trappings of science to give nonscientific ideas a veneer of validity.
This is called ``pseudoscience'' -- fake science.
