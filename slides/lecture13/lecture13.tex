%"What, then, is the meaning of it all? ... I think that we must frankly admit that {\em we do not know.}
%
%\bigskip
%
%This is not a new idea; this is the idea of the age of reason.  This is the philosophy that guided the men who made the democracy that we live under. 
%The idea that no one really knew how to run a government led to the idea that we should arrange a system by which new ideas could be developed, tried out, tossed out, more new ideas brought in; a trial and error system.  
%This method was a result of the fact that science was already showing itself to be a successful venture at the end of the 18th century.  
%Even then it was clear to sociallyâ€‘minded people that the openness of the possibilities was an opportunity, and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown.  
%If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar.
%
%\bigskip
%
%We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems....  Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions and pass them on.  
%It is our responsibility to leave the men of the future a free hand.  In the impetuous youth of humanity, we can make grave errors that can stunt our growth for a long time.
%This we will do if we say we have the answers now, so young and ignorant; if we suppress all discussion, all criticism, saying, "This is it, boys, man is saved!" and thus doom man for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination.  It has been done so many times before.
%
%\bigskip
%
%It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress and great value of a satisfactory philosophy
%of ignorance, the great progress that is the fruit of freedom of thought, to proclaim the value of this freedom, 
%to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed, and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations.

unlike the months in our calendar, which are only approximate. But 12 lunar cycles is about ten days short

the New Year happens in the same season each time.}

year, we won't see Sirius rise. However, since Sirius will rise earlier and earlier each day, eventually it 
will come up before the Sun has risen, and you'll see Sirius rise again. This event marked the ancient Egyptian
new year.}

The only difference between this and what you will do in lab is the number of objects!

	Gravity tells us the forces on all objects in space; the second law of motion tells us how that causes them to move. From this, 
	and a little math, you can predict everything about their motion.
