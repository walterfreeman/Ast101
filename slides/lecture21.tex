\item Eventually the core gets hot enough to fuse helium

More massive stars have enough weight to compress their carbon cores and fuse it to (mostly) Ne, Na, Mg, and O. 

\BS

This process releases less energy than even helium fusion, so it doesn't last as long.

\BS

Elements fuse into heavier and heavier elements, releasing less energy each time, until they reach iron in the 
heaviest stars.

\BS

Iron is ``stellar ash'' -- it can't release any more energy by fusion.

\BS 

In some of these heaviest stars, once their iron cores grow too much, 
gravity crushes them into one enormous atomic nucleus -- a neutron star.

The resulting explosion destroys the rest of the star.

\BS

It causes a flurry of nuclear reactions, forging elements heavier than iron.

\BS

It also scatters the heavy-element-rich contents of the star out to space.
This is why the Earth has so much iron in it -- and where our heavy elements come from.

\BS

It releases massive amounts of energy, forming a bright flash in the sky.

\BS

This is the Crab Nebula, the remnant of the 1054 supernova.

\BS

It was hundreds of times further away than most visible stars, but could be seen even during the day!
