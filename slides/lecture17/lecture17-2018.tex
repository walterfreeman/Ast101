Electrons in an atom can only have {\bf particular} amounts of energy!

\BS

We call these ``energy levels'', and measure their energy in ``electron volts'' (eV).

\EC

\BI
\item Usually all the electrons live in the lowest available levels
\item There's a limit to how many electrons can be in each level
\item Atoms ``fill up'' the levels starting from the bottom
\item This process leads to the periodic table

	Each electron lives in one of these energy levels at all times. 
	
	\BS
	
	They are not physical locations, but patterns of orbiting the nucleus. Higher energy levels orbit further away.

	They {\bf cannot} be in between.

	If you add energy, you can move an electron to a higher energy level.

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Atomic transitions}}

\Large

Here's a sample atom (on the document camera). These numbers aren't real; I just made them up for demonstration.

\BS

Can the electron in this atom go from $n=1$ (``ground state'') to $n=2$ (an ``excited state'')?

\BS

\color{A}A: Yes, since it's just moving from here to there \\ \BS
\color{B}B: Yes, but only if I give it 4 eV of energy from somewhere \\ \BS
\color{C}C: No, because atoms have a definite state \\ \BS
\color{D}D: No, because that doesn't conserve energy
}


\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Atomic transitions: absorption}}

\large

This extra energy usually comes from a {\it photon} -- a particle of light.

Remember that photons carry energy with them: the shorter the wavelength,
the higher the energy.

\BC
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{EMSpec.jpg}
\EC

\large

An atom can absorb a photon with
just the right energy,  jumping
up to a higher energy level in the process.
}

\frame{
\Large
What energies of photon can our sample atom absorb if it starts in $n=1$?

\BS\BS
\Large
\color{A}A: 4 eV\\ \BS
\color{B}B: 4 eV, 3 eV, 2 eV, or 1 eV\\ \BS
\color{C}C: 4 eV, 7 eV, 9 eV, or 10 eV\\ \BS
\color{D}D: Any value up to 10 eV \\ \BS
\color{E}E: Any value between 4 eV and 10 eV \\
}

\frame{
\Large

If an atom is in an excited state (maybe because it has absorbed a photon), it can
transition downward, spitting out photons in the process.

\BS

It may make {\bf any} allowed transition that jumps between energy levels.

\BS
}

\frame{
\Large
Suppose our atom absorbs a photon of 9 eV. What happens?

\BS\BS
\Large
\color{A}A: It will emit a photon of 9 eV \\ \BS 
\color{B}B: It will emit a 2 eV photon, then a 7 eV photon\\ \BS
\color{C}C: It will emit a 5 eV photon, then a 4 eV photon\\ \BS
\color{D}D: It will emit a 2 eV photon, then a 3 eV photon, then a 4 eV photon\\ \BS
\color{E}E: It will emit a 3 eV photon, then a 6 eV photon\\

\BI
\item Electrons occupy certain {\bf energy levels}
\item The particular energies that these levels have is {\bf unique} to particular elements: hydrogen has different allowed energies than mercury or neon or sodium etc.
\item An atom can absorb a photon and jump up to a higher level, conserving energy
\item ... an atom in a higher level can emit photons, jumping back down, conserving energy.
\item {\color{Red}``Nature does not make change}

\BC ... that's it. :)

If I take hydrogen and tear the electrons off of the atoms with an electric current,
they'll ``fall'' back down, going through the energy levels down to $n=1$.

\BS

Sometimes they'll skip energy levels; sometimes they'll go in sequence.

\BS

If I do this to hydrogen, what color will we see? (For reference: the visible range is 1.5-3 eV.)

\BS
\BS

\color{A}A: UV: we won't see it, since the transitions down to $n=1$ are in the UV\\

\BS

\color{B}B: Several shades of red: we'll see the transitions down to $n=2$, which are red\\ 

\BS

\color{C}C: Infrared: the transitions at the top are very low energy, corresponding to
infrared light which we can't see \\ 

\BS

\color{D}D: UV, IR, and red, all at once: all the transitions happen, but we only see the
red photons because of the limits of our eyes\\ 

\BS

\color{E}E: Orange, because this is Syracuse, darnit!

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Emission spectra}

\large

Every chemical element has a unique {\it spectrum}: the colors of light that it can emit and absorb.

\BS

Other colors simply pass through.

\BS

(Molecules have these spectra too: their electron energy levels are more complicated.)
