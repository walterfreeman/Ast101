\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Welcome!}}
\large

The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. 
Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. 
In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. 
And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. 
In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, 
explorations that are exhilarating to consider. 
They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, 
that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. 
I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.

``With more knowledge comes deeper, more wonderful mystery... 
with pleasure and confidence we turn over each new stone to find 
unimagined strangeness leading on to more wonderful questions and mysteries--certainly
a grand adventure!

Our poets 
do not write about [this]; our artists do not try to portray [it]. I don't know why. 
{\bf Is nobody inspired by our present picture of the universe?} [Science] remains unsung
by singers, so you are reduced to hearing not a song or poem, but an evening lecture about it.
Is no one inspired by our present picture of the universe? {\bf This is not yet a 
scientific age.}''

We're going to spend much of our class looking up ... but we'll spend a bit of time
looking back down, too, to see how astronomy has influenced so many fields of human endeavor.

the distance to the Sun. This is called an {\color{Red}astronomical unit}, or AU.
