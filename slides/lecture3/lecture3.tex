\item We'll collect it during class
\item If you must miss class turn it in before class to your TA's mailbox

\item Submit your ``ask the physicist'' questions in Discord or email
\item If you have a Monday lab, you'll do Lab 1 next week

\item AST101 help sessions: Wednesday 2-4PM, or Friday 9-11AM, in my office (room 215) or the Physics Clinic (room 112) if we run out of room
\pause
\item Other times in the Clinic during business hours (8AM-9PM, except Thurs 3-5PM)
\pause
\item Appointments with me by request
\pause 
\item By email: most of you have cellphone cameras...

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The tutorial-exercises}}
\Large

We won't be ``going over'' them in class -- this deprives you of an opportunity.

\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip
\pause

Remember, the goal of the tutorials isn't for you to learn {\it those} things -- it's to give you
practice in reasoning so you can figure out {\it other} things.

\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

\pause

So I am eager to discuss them with you in the help sessions, and your TA's can help you as well. Or you 
can take a cellphone picture and post your question to Discord.

\pause

\BS
If you're not sure about the reasoning involved, {\it ask us in class} or on Discord or email. We won't tell you the answers
but we'll make sure you know how to get there on your own! (That's the point...)

\item We can pretend that everything on the sky is attached to a sphere that rotates around us.
\item The axis of the sphere runs from the North Celestial Pole to the South Celestial Pole.
\item This is the same as the rotation axis of the Earth:
	\BI
\item The NCP and North Star are above the North Pole
\item The SCP and South Star (if there was one) would be ``below`` the South Pole

Really, though, we know that (-------) rotates and (-------) stays still.

Let's now figure out the motion of the stars with this knowledge.
