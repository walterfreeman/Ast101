\item 2. The line going from the Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times

Each colored wedge has the {\it same area}, and the planet takes the {\it same time} to go through each.

This means that it moves {\it faster} when it's nearer the Sun.

All objects attract all other objects with a force that is:

\BI
\item{Proportional to the product of their masses}
\item{Inversely proportional to the distance between them squared}
\EI

In symbols:

$$F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

Suppose two asteroids are floating out in space, 20 miles apart. Asteroid A is twice as massive as asteroid B,
and the force of A's gravity on B is ten tons.

Suppose I now move the two asteroids closer, so they're only 10 miles apart. What will the force of A's gravity on B be now?

\color{A}A: 5 tons\\
\color{B}B: 10 tons\\

The distance is measured between the {\it centers} of the objects.

This lets you calculate the force of a planet's gravity on people on its surface!
