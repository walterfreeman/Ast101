	This exam was difficult. 
	
	\BS\BS
	
	Exam 1 is always the hardest exam in AST101, simply because this first unit involves so much spatial reasoning and geometry. This year's was particularly difficult.
	
	\BS
	
	For many of you this will have been the hardest exam you've taken in your life so far.\pause
	
	\BS
	
	If you did well, congratulations.

	If you didn't do as well as you'd hoped, don't worry:
	
	\BI
	\item The other exams are somewhat easier
	\item We drop the lowest exam grade
	\item Many students' overall grades in AST101 are significantly higher than exam grades, because of labs, papers, and the final project
	\item This year we also have the in-class quizzes, which are sort of free points. (You can even use your notes for them!)

	\item The next exam will involve a lot less geometry, but will involve reasoning with proportions
	
	\pause \bigskip\bigskip
	
	\item Make sure you're using the previous exam wisely:

The Copernican model had a lot of attractive features, but was still less accurate -- less good at actually telling you where the things in the sky would be!

Science doesn't attempt to explain the world ``only a little bit'' -- if Nature is based on underlying physical
laws, they should predict {\it \color{Red} everything!}

Maybe our data are wrong...

\bigskip

The measurements of the sky that people had been using were ``good enough'' for navigation, but
they weren't ever intended for precision natural philosophy: determining the truth of things...

\bigskip

(In astronomy sometimes it is okay to round things off, and sometimes you need precise measurements to figure things out: 
you have to think carefully about this!)

Kepler didn't only want to discover {\it how the planets moved}; he wanted to know {\it why}. He didn't figure it out, but he was on
the path that led to modern science.

\bigskip

Even if the {\it answer} doesn't have the perfect elegance of circles, modern science looks for its elegance in {\it laws}, not in 
all of their consequences! Kepler discovered the consequences; the laws weren't uncovered yet.

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Kepler's laws of planetary motion}}
\Large

\begin{enumerate}

\item The planets move in {\it ellipses}, with the Sun at one focus

\bigskip
\bigskip

\item The line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times \\
Alternate formulation: Within its orbit, a planet's speed is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun
\bigskip
\bigskip

\item The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse.
\bigskip
\bigskip

\end{enumerate}


Let's talk about each of these in turn.
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Kepler's first law}}
\large
An ellipse is just a stretched circle. Mathematically: it's the curve around two points such that the {\it sum} of the distances to 
those points is a constant. A circle is just an ellipse with both foci at the same point.

\BC
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ellipse.png}
\EC

Some terms:
\BI
\item{Focus: One of the two points}
\item{Semimajor axis: the largest distance from the center to the edge}
\item{Eccentricity: how stretched out an ellipse is}
\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Some properties of ellipses}}
\large

\BC
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ellipse.png}
\EC

\BI
\item{The two foci always lie along the major axis (``wide axis'')}
\item{The closer together the foci, the less eccentric}
\item{If both foci are exactly at the middle, you get a circle}
\item{Both foci lie inside the ellipse}
\EI

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf {What you need to know}}
	
	\Large
	
	\BI
	
	\item Planetary orbits are ellipses
	\item The {\it eccentricity} of an ellipse tells you how squashed it is
	\item An ellipse with zero eccentricity is just a circle
	
	\BS
	
	\item The Sun lies at a focus of the ellipse, which isn't at the center (unless it's a circle)
	\item The more eccentric the orbit, the further to one side the Sun is

In an eccentric orbit, a planet travels fastest when it's nearer the Sun.

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Comets}}

\Large
Comets have highly eccentric orbits. Halley's Comet's furthest point from the Sun -- its {\it aphelion} -- is 35 AU away.
But its {\it perihelion} -- the nearest point to the Sun -- is 0.6 AU away.

\bigskip
\bigskip

Which statement is true?

\color{A}A: Halley's Comet spends most of its time far from the Sun, and only a little time near the Sun \\
\color{B}B: Halley's Comet moves slowly near perihelion, and quickly at aphelion  \\
\color{C}C: Halley's Comet moves quickly near perihelion, and slowly at aphelion \\
\color{D}D: Halley's Comet spends roughly equal amounts of time near the Sun, and far from it

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Kepler's Third Law}}

\Large
Kepler's third law of orbital motion says that the square of a planet's {\it orbital period} is proportional
to the cube of its {\it semimajor axis}.

\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

Simply put: if a planet is further from the Sun, it takes longer to go around.

\bigskip

If the distance is doubled, the time required {\it more than doubles}.
