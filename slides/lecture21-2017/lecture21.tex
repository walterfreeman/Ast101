Mercury's surface is pockmarked with craters. This tells us:

\BI 
\item It clearly has been hit by asteroids.
\item It didn't have an atmosphere when this happened
\item No weathering, geologic activity, or the like has taken place since

\item Only a thin atmosphere, mostly $\rm CO_2$
\item Large volcanoes, none active
\item Evidence of interior heat, but not like Earth and Venus
\item Evidence that liquid water once ran on its surface
\item Evidence that it once had an atmosphere of water and $\rm CO_2$
\item Evidence that was once much warmer than it is today
\pause
\item ... what happened?
\EI

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Rusty, peaceful Mars...}

\BI

\item Mars lost its atmosphere

\item Decline in interior heat $\rightarrow$ less volcanism?
\item Solar wind stripping the atmosphere away?
\item Still an area of active research

\frame{\frametitle{\bf The greenhouse effect}
Venus has a {\it tremendously thick} atmosphere and a powerful greenhouse effect.

\BI
\item Its atmosphere contains a great deal of $\rm CO_2$, which reflects IR strongly
\item The thermal radiation that would carry heat away from Venus can't get out
\item It is over 400 K hotter than was predicted by the calculation you are doing this week
\EI

\BS

Earth has a {\it thinner} atmosphere.

\BI
\item Nitrogen doesn't absorb strongly at any relevant wavelengths
\item $\rm H_2 O$ and $\rm CO_2$ are strong greenhouse gases, but they are only a bit of the atmosphere
\item We are about 20 K warmer than predicted by that crude math
\item These gases are very important for determining Earth's temperature!
