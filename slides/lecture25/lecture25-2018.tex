I still remember when the first time I pointed the telescope at the sky and I saw Saturn with the rings. It was a beautiful image. And that really made my mind to become a scientist. And that was the first step in order to become an astronaut, of course.

It's amazing to me that not only can we put a probe around Saturn and get images of its moons, but our math and physics are so freaking accurate we can say, ``Hey, you know what? On this date at this time if we turn Cassini 
that way weâ€™ll see a moon over 2 million kilometers away pass in front of another one nearly 3 million kilometers away.''
Every morning, I have a 50/50 chance of finding my keys. That kinda puts things in perspective.

\item Mission of several years (there and back)

\item Would need rockets larger than Saturn V, but not impossibly so
\item Several clever ways to use robotics to reduce the size of the rockets needed (Mars Direct)
\EI

\BS

Going beyond would likely require substantial improvements in rockets.

\BS

Remember: a small improvement in exhaust velocity gives an exponential increase in how fast a rocket can make you go (and where you can go with it)

The problem here is {\it time}. We could send a probe to Alpha Centauri now -- 4.3 ly (270,000 AU away). Should we?

%\item Sail on the solar wind, or on a laser from Earth or Earth orbit?

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Improving humans and changing our outlook}
With only a little improvement in rockets, we can conquer space.

\BS

Science-fiction authors dream of ``faster-than-light travel'', but this is likely not possible. 

\BS

If we take to the stars, humans will be possibly be born, grow, live, love, and die in space. If we stay there long,
we will no doubt evolve to match our new surroundings...

\BS

There are ways to cheat: cryogenics, freezing embryos and trusting robots to teach babies how to be human...

\BS

Even then, a mission to Alpha Centauri is a mission that will outlive those that send it.

\BS

The greatest challenge in spacefaring won't be engineering, science, or even economics -- it will be {\it philosophy}.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.''

In this class I've aimed to both teach you a little astronomy, and how to think scientifically ... but, also, to connect astronomy to the broader
story of human thought.
