I still remember when the first time I pointed the telescope at the sky and I saw Saturn with the rings. It was a beautiful image. And that really made my mind to become a scientist. And that was the first step in order to become an astronaut, of course.

It's amazing to me that not only can we put a probe around Saturn and get images of its moons, but our math and physics are so freaking accurate we can say, ``Hey, you know what? On this date at this time if we turn Cassini 
that way weâ€™ll see a moon over 2 million kilometers away pass in front of another one nearly 3 million kilometers away.''
Every morning, I have a 50/50 chance of finding my keys. That kinda puts things in perspective.

Science-fiction authors dream of ``faster-than-light travel'', but this is likely not possible.

If we take to the stars, humans will be possibly be born, grow, live, love, and die in space. If we stay there long,

``Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -- on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

\medskip\BS

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark....

\medskip

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

\medskip

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.''

But...

\BS

We can look at all of this, here from our little mote of dust...

\BS

... we can understand how it works -- we, our little carbon-and-water brains, can comprehend the steps in the dance that the Universe is dancing.

\BS

\pause

... and it's the same everywhere. We -- our star, our planet, and our bodies -- are part of it, and we can fathom how it works.

So, if our bodies and our planet are very small -- how much our minds can accomplish!

We take this feedback seriously; as we emerge from the pandemic and I try new things, I am especially interested in what you have to say.

Thank you for your patience as I've tried different things, seen what you all like, and what you don't.

``With more knowledge comes deeper, more wonderful mystery...
with pleasure and confidence we turn over each new stone to find
unimagined strangeness leading on to more wonderful questions and mysteries--certainly
a grand adventure!

Our poets
do not write about [this]; our artists do not try to portray [it]. I don't know why.
{\bf Is nobody inspired by our present picture of the universe?} [Science] remains unsung

Is no one inspired by our present picture of the universe? {\bf This is not yet a

What comes next, if you want more of this sort of thing?

Our class covered astronomy inside the Solar System.

\BS

AST104 covers the rest of the Universe:

\BI
\item The life and death of stars
\item Galaxies
\item Neutron stars
\item Black holes
\item Gravitational waves
\item The origin and fate of the Universe
\EI

... the really awesome stuff!

\BS

It'll be taught next semester by {\color{Red}Prof. Scott Watson},
who is a great human being. 

\BS

Because of a registrar error space is quite limited -- if you can't get 
in, keep checking!

\item Relativity and cosmology

A degree in physics is a highly-valued thing in industry -- you can study the stars and the natural world, and then have a great shot at a good job.

When I was asked to teach this class, Patty Whitmore (then academic coordinator) told me: ``These folks aren't here to learn mathematics. They're not here to learn 
only the laws of physics; they're here to learn what science is about.''

\BS\BS

In this class I've aimed to both teach you a little astronomy, and how to think scientifically ... but, also, to connect astronomy to the broader
story of human thought.

\BS\BS\pause

In the end, we look at the sky because it's beautiful -- and because it's inspiring.

In 2018, I ended this class with a poem by James Agee about the beauty of the 
night sky, which was set to music by Morton Lauridsen. 

\BS\BS\pause

I played a faraway man's music and showed a dead man's poem.

\BS\BS\pause

We took the final exam.

\BS\BS\pause

And then our head TA and I worked for {\it days} looking at and grading your final projects. So many of them were {\it stunning}.

\BS\BS\pause

But, on the 27th of December, exhausted and both sick from eating nothing but pizza for two days, we arrived at Annie Shi's -- and it is with her words that I'd like to end this year's class.
