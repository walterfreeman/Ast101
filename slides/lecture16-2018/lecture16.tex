\item Grades on labs and papers tend to run quite a bit higher than on exams in AST101, so your overall course grade will likely 
be a letter grade or more higher than your exam grades.

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Light and spectra}

\Large\BC

White light isn't really white; it's a mix of many colors (wavelengths).

\BS

Our eyes are very limited; we can only distinguish between three colors.

\BS

We can learn a lot about an object by the colors of light it emits, but we have to be able to see them first!

\BS

We do that by spreading them out. Then we can see what colors are there in great detail.

{\color{Red}Objects glow because they're hot. This is called {\it thermal radiation}.}
\EC
\BS
\BS
\normalsize
\BI
\item Any object with a temperature emits electromagnetic radiation (``light'').
\item For objects as warm as we are, this is in the ``far infrared''.
\item As objects heat up, the peak wavelength decreases (the average photon energy increases)
\item As objects heat up, the total intensity emitted goes up {\it rapidly} (proportional to $T^4$)
\item This is also called ``blackbody radiation'' (since even a black object glows if it's warmed up)
\EI

See the simulation to see how this works...

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Takeaways: thermal radiation}}

\Large

\BI
\item Any object with a temperature glows
\item Hotter objects glow ``bluer'' (shorter wavelengths) and brighter
\item Hotter objects emit more light per unit area (of all wavelengths)
\item A larger object that is cold (large red star) may emit more total light than a small object that is hot (small yellow star)
\item This glow is a {\it broad spread of wavelengths} -- there aren't narrow bright or dark lines in it

It's important to know, roughly, what temperature objects emit radiation of what wavelengths (mostly):
