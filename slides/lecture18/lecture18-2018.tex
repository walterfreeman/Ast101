\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{What we know so far}}

\Large

Hot objects emit light (thermal radiation):

\BI
\item This light is a broad spread of wavelengths 
\item The hotter the object, the shorter (``bluer'') they are
\EI

Atoms have energy levels that the electrons occupy. Electrons can:

\BI
\item Absorb a photon whose energy is equal to the difference between energy levels, and move up
\item Emit a photon whose energy is equal to the difference between energy levels, and move down
\EI

The pattern of energy levels is specific to each atom, but in general, the higher ones are closer together.
}

\frame{

The first few energy levels of hydrogen are: 0 eV, 10.2 eV, 12.1 eV, and 12.8 eV. 

\BS

If I take hydrogen and tear the electrons off of the atoms with an electric current,
they'll ``fall'' back down, going through the energy levels down to $n=1$.

\BS

If I do this to hydrogen, what color will we see? (For reference: the visible range is 1.5-3 eV.)

\BS
\BS

\color{A}A: UV: we won't see it, since the transitions down to $n=1$ are in the UV\\

\BS

\color{B}B: Several shades of red: we'll see the transitions down to $n=2$, which are red\\ 

\BS

\color{C}C: Infrared: the transitions at the top are very low energy, corresponding to
infrared light which we can't see \\ 

\BS

\color{D}D: UV, IR, and red, all at once: all the transitions happen, but we only see the
red photons because of the limits of our eyes\\ 

\BS

\pause

\color{E}E: Orange, because this is Syracuse, darnit! 
}

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Emission spectra}

\large

Every chemical element has a unique {\it spectrum}: the colors of light that it can emit and absorb.

\BS

Other colors simply pass through.

\BS

(Molecules have these spectra too: their electron energy levels are more complicated.)

Suppose I put a 5000 K object behind a cloud of gas with energy levels at 0, 3, and 5 eV, and then look at the 
energies of the photons that come out the other side. 
\EC

\Large
\color{A}A: Photons with energy 3 and 5 eV \\

\BS

\color{B}B: Photons with energy 2, 3, and 5 eV \\

\color{C}C: Photons of a wide range of energies, {\it except} 3 and 5 eV \\


\BS

\color{D}D: Photons of a wide range of energies, {\it except} 2, 3, and 5 eV \\

Suppose I put a 5000 K object behind a cloud of gas with energy levels at 0, 3, and 5 eV, and then 
separate its light by color. (Assume that I am a bird and can see ultraviolet light.) What would I see?
\EC

\BS

\Large
\color{A}A: Only two bright lines \\ 

\BS

\color{B}B: Only three bright lines \\ 

\BS

\color{C}C: A solid band of color, but with two dark lines \\ 


\BS

\color{D}D: A solid band of color, but with three dark lines \\

If you excite a diffuse gas, it will {\it emit} light of particular colors that correspond to its transitions.

How do we use this to learn about astronomy?

\HC
Every element has its own ``fingerprint'', based on its unique energy levels.
\BS

We can measure those fingerprints easily on Earth with emission lamps.

\BS

Then, if we see them in the sky -- either in emission or absorption -- we know
where they came from!

\color{C}C: There's an element in the Sun that's not on Earth -- call it {\bf sunium} \\ \BS

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf What a lucky accident!}
\large 
We're very lucky that atomic transitions happen to lie in our visual range!

There are others that are very interesting to astronomers:

\BI
\item Molecular vibrations: infrared
\pause
\item Molecular {\it rotations}: microwave
\pause
\item ``Hyperfine structure'' energy levels in hydrogen: 21 cm radio waves
\EI

\pause

\normalsize

This last is particularly interesting: it is a very particular frequency, echoing out from
all corners of the Universe, that says: hydrogen is here. (Hydrogen is 75\% of the universe.)
