\frame{\frametitle{\bf{An illuminating story}}

In the late 19th century, the laws of electromagnetism looked like this:

\BI
\item Electric fields exert a force on electric charges
\item Magnetic fields exert a force on {\it moving} electric charges
\EI

\bigskip

We know this thanks in large part to the work of Michael Faraday, who
famously wasn't good at algebra and drew pictures of fields.

\bigskip

Where do these fields come from?

\BI
\item Electric charges make electric fields
\item Moving electric charges make magnetic fields
\item Changing magnetic fields make electric fields
\pause
\item {\color{Red} Changing electric fields make magnetic fields}
\EI

\BS

Last law added by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860's, and it has
a surprising consequence:

\BS
\BI
\item{Changing electric field makes a magnetic field}
\pause \item ... which makes a magnetic field ...
\pause \item ... which makes an electric field further away ...
\pause \item This leads to a traveling electromagnetic disturbance: an {\it electromagnetic wave}.

\frame{\frametitle{\bf{An illuminating story}}

Maxwell calculated that these electromagnetic waves traveled at
around 300 million meters per second.

\BS

Independently, light had been measured to travel at 300 million
meters per second some years prior.

\BS \pause

So ... if this electromagnetic wave travels at the speed of
light, perhaps it {\it is} light?

\BS

In the history of science, sometimes theory gets ahead of experiment -- like in the discovery of the nature of light.

\BC
Light is a traveling {\it electromagnetic wave}. This means:
\EC

\BS
\large

\BI
\item ... it moves through space at some {\color{Red}speed: the speed of light, $c=3 \times 10^8$ m/s.}
\pause\BS
\item ... these waves have a {\color{Yellow}wavelength}: the distance from peak to peak of the electric field. We use the letter {\color{Yellow}$\lambda$} for wavelength.
\pause\BS
\item ... and, as an observer holds still, a certain number of waves pass that observer per second. This is called the {\color{Green}frequency, $f$}.
\EI

\item \color{Red}Wave speed: $c$
\item \color{Yellow}Wavelength: $\lambda$

If I keep {\color{Red}$c$} constant and increase {\color{Yellow}$f$}, then {\color{Green}$\lambda$} will \underline{\hspace{3cm}}...

\BS\BS
If I keep {\color{Red}$c$} constant and decrease {\color{Yellow}$f$}, then {\color{Green}$\lambda$} will \underline{\hspace{3cm}}...

\BS\BS

If I keep {\color{Green}$\lambda$} constant and increase {\color{Red}$c$}, then {\color{Yellow}$f$} will \underline{\hspace{3cm}}...
}

\frame{
\Large
\BC
This leads us to the basic relation:
\Huge $$\color{Red}c = \color{Yellow}f \color{Green}\lambda$$
\large
Or in words:
\huge
$$
{\color{Red}(\text {speed of light})} = {\color{Yellow}(\text{frequency})} \times {\color{Green}(\text{wavelength})}
$$

\large

This is easy to remember by thinking about how each quantity is measured:
\huge
$$
{\color{Red}\frac{\text {meters}}{\text{second}}} = {\color{Yellow}\frac{\text{waves}}{\text{second}} }\times {\color{Green}\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{wave}}}
$$

\EC



This means:
\large
\BI
\item Shorter wavelengths have higher frequency
\item Longer wavelengths have lower frequency
\pause
\item You will not need to calculate anything here -- just know the above

Newton wrote about light, and thought that it came in little chunks called {\it corpuscles} that flew through space in
straight lines, like bullets.

\BS

Maxwell deduced that it was a {\color{Red}wave}, and experiments confirmed that.

\BS\BS\pause
You should know:

\BI
\item Energy per photon is {\it proportional} to the frequency of the light
\item Energy per photon is {\it inversely proportional} to its wavelength
\item Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency
\EI
... but later experiments (which we'll see soon) showed that it had to come in discrete chunks! What gives?

\BS

Is light a wave, or is it a bunch of little {\color{Green}particles?}

\BS\BS

It turns out that, in quantum mechanics, it can be {\it both}, and everyone gets to be right!

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The quantum nature of light}}

Light has both particle properties and wave properties:

\BI
\item Particle properties: it comes in discrete chunks called {\it photons}, each carrying a certain {\color{Green}energy}.
\item Wave properties: it has a {\color{Red} wavelength} $\lambda$ and {\color{Red} frequency} $f$ 
\EI

It turns out that shorter-wavelength, higher-frequency light has higher energy per photon. The relationship is:

\Huge
$$E=hf=hc/\lambda$$

\large

This value $h$ is called Planck's constant. It is baked into the fabric of the Universe, like $G$ and $c$:

\bigskip
\BI
\item $G$, the universal gravitational constant: tells us how strong gravity is
\item $c$, the speed of light: tells us how fast light goes
\pause
\item \color{Red}$h$, Planck's constant: tells us how ``lumpy'' light is: how much energy do photons of a given frequency have?
\EI

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Things you should know:}}

\Large Light is both a particle and a wave.
\BS

\BI
\item All light travels at the same speed, $c = $ 300 million m/s, in vacuum
\item Light comes in little lumps called {\it photons}
\item Energy per photon is {\it proportional} to the frequency of the light
\item Energy per photon is {\it inversely proportional} to its wavelength
\item Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency
