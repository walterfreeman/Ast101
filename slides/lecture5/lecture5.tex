\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{What is one incorrect explanation for why we have summer and winter?}}

\rm A popular misconception is that the distance of the Earth compared to the Sun defines the season.
The Earth revolves around the Sun at nearly the same distance from the 
Sun, so this explanation does not make sense.\it

\begin{flushright} --Zach\end{flushright}
\pause
\rm Because earth is farther from the sun in winter, and closer to the sun in summer.
[We know this isn't right because] The sun does not get any larger or smaller during these seasons.\it

\begin{flushright} --Doug\end{flushright}
\pause

\rm Hades, the ancient Greek god of the underworld, kidnapped/seduced Persephone, the goddess of springtime. 
After many shenanigans involving a pomegranate and the deaths of many humans, Zeus, 
king of the gods, decreed that Persephone would spend half the year in the underworld with Hades, 
who was now her husband. 
During this half of the year, the earth would be left  barren and cold, thus accounting for the winter months. 
The other half of the year, Persephone would return to the earth's surface and rejuvenate it, bringing about summertime.

In this day and age, I wouldn't really have to try too hard to convince them that this story isn't real. 
I'd point out that there is actually no factual evidence to show the existence of Ancient Greek deities, 
and would remind them that the sun is a flaming orb of hydrogen rather than a dude in a chariot. \it

\begin{flushright} --Rachel\end{flushright}

\frame{

Because the sun is farther from us in the winter than in the summer... [We know this isn't right because,] If the seasons depend on the distance, the whole Earth should experience the same season [at] the same time. However, the seasons in the southern hemisphere are different from the seasons in the northern hemisphere.

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The tilt of the Earth's axis}}
\BC\Large
The Earth's axis of rotation is not lined up with its orbital axis. \\

\bigskip

It's tilted by 23.4 degrees.

\bigskip

The axis of rotation changes {\color{Red}only very slowly} (over millennia).

I. Move higher and lower in the sky \\
II. Move east/west relative to the stars

The region on Earth where the Sun alternates between the northern sky and the southern sky is called the 
{\color{Red} tropics}.

\item{The northern boundary is called the {\color{Red}Tropic of Cancer}}
\item{The southern boundary is called the {\color{Red}Tropic of Capricorn}}

On the June solstice, the sun reaches the zenith along the Tropic of Cancer.

On the December solstice, the sun reaches the zenith along the Tropic of Capricorn.

The region where the sun either never rises or never sets during part of the year 
is called the Arctic (north) or Antarctic (south).



\bigskip

\BI
\item{North of the Arctic Circle, the sun never rises on the December solstice, and never sets on the June solstice.}
\item{South of the Antarctic Circle, the sun never sets on the December solstice, and never rises on the June solstice.}

The tilt of the Earth toward/away from the Sun controls the amount of sunlight we get at different times of year!

\bigskip

This happens for two important reasons. Thinking about the Northern hemisphere...
