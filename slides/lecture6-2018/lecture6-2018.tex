\begin{center}

People often think that the seasons are caused by the changing distance to the Sun, but this isn't the case. How can we know this?

\end{center}

{\it The maximum height of the sun in the sky is lower in winter than summer. It is more important how direct the sunlight is based on the tilt of the earth, rather than distance.}

{\it ...[i]n actuality, the sun is farther away from Earth during the season for the northern hemisphere.}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The tilt of the Earth's axis}}
\BC\Large
The Earth's axis of rotation is not lined up with its orbital axis. \\

\bigskip

It's tilted by 23.4 degrees.

\bigskip

The axis of rotation changes {\color{Red}only very slowly} (over millennia) -- we talked about this last time in
response to your questions about the Zodiac.

On the June solstice, the sun reaches the zenith along the Tropic of Cancer.

On the December solstice, the sun reaches the zenith along the Tropic of Capricorn.
