Simple solution, first used in East Asia: carry gas (or anything else) with you, and push it out the back!

\BS

\BCC

The Chinese had been using rockets in warfare as early as 1280, using the gunpowder also developed in China.

The Koreans and Mongolians quickly adopted the new weapon, and the technology spread around Eurasia in the next few centuries.

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Tsiolkovsky: making rockets precise}

The Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935) was the first to study the physics of rocketry in depth. (He also studied music
and the problem of poverty.)

\BS

He discovered the {\it rocket equation}, which describes the performance of a perfect, ideal rocket:

$$
\Delta V = v_e \ln F
$$

Here:

\BI
\item $\Delta V$ is the speed that the rocket will be traveling after it burns its fuel
\BI
\item To escape Earth's gravity: about 11 kilometers/second (calculated by Tsiolkovsky)
\EI
\item $v_e$ is the exhaust velocity of the rocket (how fast the gas comes out the back)
\item $F$ is how many times bigger the rocket is than its payload
\BI
\item Here ``payload'' means every part of the rocket that isn't fuel
\EI
\EI

We can make the math easier and rearrange this:

$$
F = (2.719)^{V/v_e} \equiv e^{V/v_e}
$$

}

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Tsiolkovsky: making rockets precise}

Tsiolkovsky realized that rockets could take us to space, and wrote about this in 1903: ``Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Rocket Devices''

But what kind of fuel is needed? Let's make a table here. Suppose we want to lift a ton to orbit; how much fuel do we need?

The problem with rockets: you have to carry your fuel with you. The less efficient your fuel is, the more fuel you need, so you need more fuel to carry
that fuel...

\BS

And, if you want to come back from wherever you went, you need even {\it more} fuel...

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Robert Goddard: making rockets}

Robert Goddard (American; 1882-1945) had a long-running interest in rocketry as a means to get to space. He:

\BI
\item took Tsiolkovsky's ideas and put them into practice
\item realized that a specially-shaped rocket nozzle could greatly increase exhaust speeds (remember how much this matters!)
\item achieved exhaust speeds of 8600 km/hr
\pause
\item believed that a rocket could reach the Moon!

For the first time, we have a plan: a machine whose workings we understand that can get us to the Moon!

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Rockets as a weapon}

Humanity's dream of flight to the Moon was interrupted by the Second World War, with rockets pressed into service to kill each other.

\BS

All sides in the war used rocket weapons, but the most famous and largest was the German V-2:
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94T8VxOOvdI}

\BS

These rockets, designed by a team of German engineers led by Werhner von Braun, were fired across the English Channel at London.
They didn't do much damage, but were terrifying.

\pause\BS

After WWII, the Cold War was on: the Americans and the Soviets thought it was just a matter of time until they were at war. 

\BS

Both sides rushed to capture von Braun and his team; the Americans got there first, and brought them back to Alabama.

\BS

\pause

One of them lived across the street from me when I was a child. Another one was my high school English teacher.

}



\frame{\frametitle{\bf The Cold War}

Both Americans and Soviets lived in constant fear of nuclear war. 

\BS

A rocket that could deliver a nuclear warhead was the ultimate weapon: an ICBM.

\BS

So rocket technology was key to ``winning'' the Cold War.

\BS

Both sides wanted to demonstrate their superiority. The Soviets, however, beat us: showing their mastery of the technology that could be used
to kill tens of millions of Americans in a fraction of an hour.
}

\frame{\frametitle{\bf Sputnik and Vostok}
In 1957, the Soviets got there first, and launched the first satellite: Sputnik. \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvPzUAeWZZY}

\pause\BS

This {\it terrified} the Americans: if you can put a satellite in orbit, you can get a thermonuclear bomb anywhere on Earth's surface.
We created NASA in response and desperately tried to catch up, with a concentrated effort to recruit engineers and scientists to work on the project. 

\BS\pause\BS

Then in 1961 the Soviets launched a human to space, Yuri Gagarin, who orbited the Earth and returned safely.
