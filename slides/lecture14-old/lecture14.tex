\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{First: Science!}}

\large

The discoveries of Kepler, Galileo, and Newton did more than explain the solar system.

\bigskip

They merged disciplines that had been separate since the time of the Greeks:

\BI
\item Natural philosophy: ``what is the truth of Nature?'' (truth-seeking)
\item Astronomy: ``Where can I find Mars next week?'' (practical applications)
\EI

\bigskip

Newton brought us into the age of {\it astrophysics} -- possibly the first true {\it science}. What's that mean?

\pause

\BI
\item Truth in precision
\item Synergy between truth-seeking and practical observation
\item Synergy between theory and experiment
\BI
\item Theory: ``Use things we've already observed to design a model''
\item Exp't: ``Carefully choose observations to make to inform/test models''
\EI
\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The scientific method}}
\Large
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``Huh, that is interesting -- I wonder how it works?''
\item Develop a {\it model}: a picture that explains as much as you can
\item Compare the predictions of your model to real-world observations
\pause
\BI
\item Partial agreement: can we refine the model? (Copernicus)
\item Complete disagreement: Tear it up and go back to (1)
\EI
\item Model agrees with observations so far: It's a useful {\it theory}
\pause
\item Does the model predict new things not yet observed?
\item Design observations to test for them (experiments!)
\BI
\item Partial agreement: can we refine the model?
\item Complete disagreement: Tear it up and go back to (1)
\EI
\pause
\item Body of supporting evidence grows
\item Continually seek to expand the {\it scope} of the model with more observations
\end{enumerate}

\item Expanding the scope: 
\BI

\item Atoms and molecules
\item ``I wonder how heat works?'' --Everyone

What things do scientific explanations have in common?

\EC

\bigskip

\BI 
\pause
\item ``We can understand this thing!'' -- explanations must be {\color{Red} natural}
\pause
\item Models try to be {\color{Red}universal}
\pause
\item Predictions are {\color{Red}testable}
\pause
\item Studies try to be {\color{Red}objective} (this is hard -- statistics helps)
\pause
\item Studies are at least in principle {\color{Red}replicable} -- anyone can redo them

\bigskip \pause

\item Scientific explanations are {\color{Red}not anthropocentric} -- they don't give humans (or Earth) a special role
\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{Scientific integrity}}
\large
``But this long history of learning how not to fool ourselves--of
having utter scientific integrity--is, I'm sorry to say, something
that we haven't specifically included in any particular course that
I know of. We just hope you've caught on by osmosis.
 
The first principle is that you must not fool yourself--and you are
the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about
that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other
scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after
that.

\medskip
\BC ... \EC
\medskip

I'm talking about
a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending
over backwards to show how you are maybe wrong, that you ought to
have when acting as a scientist.

\medskip
\BC ... \EC
\medskip

One example of the principle is this: If you've made up your mind
to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should
always decide to publish it whichever way it comes out. If we only
publish results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look
good. We must publish both kinds of results.''

There's an entire discipline of mathematics designed to, in an objective way, examine what results mean: {\color{Red} statistics.}

This synergistic enterprise has been behind a vast amount of progress for humanity in the last 350 years.

As with anything powerful, this process can be corrupted:

\BI
\item{Confirmation bias / placebo effect}

\item Profit motive: vaccines causing autism
\item Publication bias (jellybeans!)
\item Artificially limited scope (some psych studies)

``Our time is distinguished by wonderful achievements in the fields of scientific understanding and the technical application of those insights. Who would not be cheered by this? But let us not forget that human knowledge and skills alone cannot lead humanity to a happy and dignified life. Humanity has every reason to place the proclaimers of high moral standards and values above the discoverers of objective truth. What humanity owes to personalities like Buddha, Moses, and Jesus ranks for me higher than all the achievements of the enquiring and constructive mind.
What these blessed men have given us we must guard and try to keep alive with all our strength if humanity is not to lose its dignity, the security of its existence, and its joy in living.''
