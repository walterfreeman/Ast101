Sounds can have a spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths, 
and we can only perceive a piece of that spectrum.

In the same way {\it light} has a spectrum of frequencies/wavelengths, 
and our eyes only perceive a tiny fraction of that spectrum.

ones we can see!

\frame{\frametitle{\bf{An illuminating story}}

In the late 19th century, the laws of electromagnetism looked like this:

\BI
\item Electric fields exert a force on electric charges
\item Magnetic fields exert a force on {\it moving} electric charges
\EI

\bigskip

We know this thanks in large part to the work of Michael Faraday, who
famously wasn't good at algebra and drew pictures of fields.

\bigskip

Where do these fields come from?

\BI
\item Electric charges make electric fields
\item Moving electric charges make magnetic fields
\item Changing magnetic fields make electric fields
\pause
\item {\color{Red} Changing electric fields make magnetic fields}
\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\bf{An illuminating story}}

\BI
\item Electric charges make electric fields
\item Moving electric charges make magnetic fields
\item Changing magnetic fields make electric fields
\item {\color{Red} Changing electric fields make magnetic fields}
\EI

\BS

Last law added by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860's, and it has
a surprising consequence:

\BS
\BI
\item{Changing electric field makes a magnetic field}
\pause \item ... which makes a magnetic field ...
\pause \item ... which makes an electric field further away ...
\pause \item This leads to a traveling electromagnetic disturbance: an {\it electromagnetic wave}.
\EI
}

\frame{\frametitle{\bf{An illuminating story}}

Maxwell calculated that these electromagnetic waves traveled at
around 300 million meters per second.

\BS

Independently, light had been measured to travel at 300 million
meters per second some years prior.

\BS \pause

So ... if this electromagnetic wave travels at the speed of
light, perhaps it {\it is} light?

\BS

In the history of science, sometimes theory gets ahead of experiment -- like in the discovery of the nature of light.

\frame{\frametitle{\bf{The properties of waves}}

\BC
Light is a traveling {\it electromagnetic wave}. This means:
\EC

\BS
\large

\BI
\item ... it moves through space at some {\color{Red}speed}: the speed of light, $c=3 \times 10^8$ m/s.
\pause\BS
\item ... these waves have a {\color{Yellow}wavelength}: the distance from peak to peak of the electric field. We use the letter $\lambda$ for wavelength.
\pause\BS
\item ... and, as an observer holds still, a certain number of waves pass that observer per second. This is called the {\color{Green}frequency}, $f$.
\EI

\BC 
\Large How are these things related? Let's look at a simulation...
\EC

Three basic wave properties:

\BI
\item Wave speed: $c$
\item Wavelength: $\lambda$
\item Frequency: $f$
\EI

\BS\BS

If I keep $c$ constant and increase $f$, then $\lambda$ will \underline{\hspace{3cm}}...

\BS\BS

If I keep $c$ constant and decrease $f$, then $\lambda$ will \underline{\hspace{3cm}}...

\BS\BS

If I keep $\lambda$ constant and increase $c$, then $f$ will \underline{\hspace{3cm}}...
}

\frame{
\Large
\BC
This leads us to the basic relation:
\Huge $$c = f \lambda$$
\EC

This means:
\large
\BI
\item Shorter wavelengths have higher frequency
\item Longer wavelengths have lower frequency
\EI

}

\frame{
\Large

Newton wrote about light, and thought that it came in little chunks called {\it corpuscles} that flew through space in
straight lines, like bullets.

\BS

Maxwell deduced that it was a {\color{Red}wave}, and experiments confirmed that.

\BS\BS\pause

... but later experiments (which we'll see soon) showed that it had to come in discrete chunks! What gives?

\BS

Is light a wave, or is it a bunch of little {\color{Green}particles?}

\BS\BS

It turns out that, in quantum mechanics, it can be {\it both}, and everyone gets to be right!

}

\frame{\frametitle{\textbf{The quantum nature of light}}

Light has both particle properties and wave properties:

\BI
\item Particle properties: it comes in discrete chunks called {\it photons}, each carrying a certain {\color{Green}energy}.
\item Wave properties: it has a {\color{Red} wavelength} $\lambda$ and {\color{Red} frequency} $f$ 
\EI

It turns out that shorter-wavelength, higher-frequency light has higher energy per photon. The relationship is:

\Huge
$$E=hf=hc/\lambda$$

\large

You should know:

\BI
\item Energy per photon is {\it proportional} to the frequency of the light
\item Energy per photon is {\it inversely proportional} to its wavelength
\item Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency
\EI

We have lots of names for different sorts of light.

\BS

They differ only in wavelength/energy/frequency, and the other things they interact with.
\EC

\large
\BI
\item Radio waves: used to communicate over long distances

\BS

\item Microwaves: used to communicate over short distances

\BS

\item ``Far infrared'': associated with objects with temperatures close to ours

\BS

\item ``Near infrared'': much like light, but we can't see it

\BS

\item Visible light (only a very narrow range!)

\BS

\item Ultraviolet: enough energy to disrupt atoms

\BS

\item X-rays: enough energy to penetrate human tissue

\BS

\item Gamma rays: enough energy to disrupt atomic nuclei!
