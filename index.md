Pending ask-the-physicist questions:

Cal Parker asks: Does the universe have an edge?

<!-- Dmytro Kuchirka asks: I have a question regarding the velocity of Earth. If it was increased to the speed approximate to the simulation you showed in class how would it affect life on Earth and what changes could mankind and Earth experience? -->

Paritosh Jain asks: what is a neutron star? 

Chris Ruan asks:  I know the earth, moon, stars,etc are moving, but does the Milky Way Galaxy also moving? In which direction? Move towards where? How does the whole universe travel?

Alex Wyers asks: In *Star Wars*, the planet Tatooine has two suns. Besides making the planet incredibly hot all the time, what other effects might this have on the planet, and have we observed any solar systems in the real world with two suns similar to Tatooine?

Abigail Cramer asks: Will [global warming] affect the air outside of our atmosphere and since molecules move faster in a heated environment, will this change overall cause more “things” to enter our atmosphere leading to higher risk of issues related to the things. Does that make sense, basically, will our beat impact the asteroids and space things outside and potentially cause them to move in a way that will negatively impact our species and life on this planet? Yet another reason to work on climate change if so...
