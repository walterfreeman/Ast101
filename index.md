**Announcements:**

Welcome to Astronomy 101! This website will have everything related to our class on it; nothing will be posted on Blackboard other than your grades.

Labs start this week! Remember, you need to do the [prelab](labs/lab1prelab.pdf) before you come to lab.

If you're having trouble installing and running Stellarium on your Mac, [here are some instructions](stellarium-mac.html).
You can also do everything you need on the web version; the interface is just a little different.
