**Announcements:**

Welcome to Astronomy 101! This website will have everything related to our class on it; nothing will be posted on Blackboard other than your grades.

Before Thursday's class, you should:

* Read the [syllabus](syllabus.html)
* Join the [course Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/suphysics/shared_invite/enQtNzI2MzU4NzU5NDI2LWMxZWE2MmYzMjVmZGMzZWU5ZDk5OWFkYjMyMmI5ZGIyZDBkMDZiMjFmY2YzYWY1Y2U5ODY3ZDNlNDhmMDczMzk) (and post memes to #ast101memes :) )
* Arrange to get the textbooks if you haven't already
