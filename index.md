This website is a placeholder for now. While you're waiting for class to begin, remember that you can go to <https://piazza.com/syr/fall2020/ast101> to sign up for Piazza and ask questions there.

Tuesday's class will be held on Zoom. I will send the link out and post it here Monday night.

You may also tune in on Twitch at <https://twitch.tv/suphysics> if the Zoom room gets full. Right now this is just showing a live view of the night sky as seen from Syracuse. 

See you all Tuesday!
