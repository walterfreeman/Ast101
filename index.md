**Your group assignments and Project 1**, to get to know your groups and think about some basic things about the night sky, is available now. 

The <a href="groups1.html">Group Information page</a> has everything you need to know. Once you are there, people are listed alphabetically by email address.
You can also just search for your name (although you might appear in other people's information too).

I am still behind on answering email. I'm very sorry and will catch up ASAP! I am caught up on Piazza questions, though -- that is a much better place to
ask things that other folks might be interested in.

If you still haven't filled out the lab time survey, then you should email <skundu@syr.edu> with your preferences. Tell him:

* your name and email
* what time you are registered for lab
* if there are any other people in that section you plan to work with
* whether you will be doing the labs in person or online

and he'll get you set up with a group.

Remember that you can go to <https://piazza.com/syr/fall2020/ast101> to sign up for Piazza and ask questions there.
