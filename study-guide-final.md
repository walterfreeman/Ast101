Here are the study guides for all four units that we used in 2018. I'm leaving the link here for 2019's class;
these may be modified slightly as we go, but most of the content will be the same.

Please note that these only tell you what topics are on the exam, and what material you are responsible for knowing. As you know by now, there is a difference between knowing something
and knowing how to apply it to learn something else. **You** are responsible for digging up the various figures in the text and notes that go along with the material, reviewing your 
**Lecture Tutorials**, and ensuring that you're well-equipped to apply this information to understand astronomy.

This is particularly true for Unit 1, which is all about geometry.
