### Final exam time and location

The final exam will be from 3:00-5:00 on December 13. The location will depend on what lecture
section you are in:

* Students in the 12:30 class will go to Stolkin Auditorium
* Students in the 2:00 class will go to Grant Auditorium in Falk College.

If for whatever reason you will not be able 
to take the final exam at this time, please let me know as soon as possible.

### Study guides

Here are the study guides for all four units.

Please note that these only tell you what topics are on the exam, and what material you are responsible for knowing. As you know by now, there is a difference between knowing something
and knowing how to apply it to learn something else. **You** are responsible for reviewing your 
in-class exercises and homework, making sure that you understand everything from the lab (which is not
in the study guides), and ensuring that you're well-equipped to apply this information to understand astronomy.

This is particularly true for Unit 1, which is all about geometry.

### In-class exercises and homework

* <a href="tutorials/celestial-sphere/celestial-sphere.pdf">The motion of the stars and the celestial sphere</a>
* <a href="tutorials/zodiac-motion/zodiac-motion.pdf">The motion of the Sun through the Zodiac</a>
* <a href="tutorials/the-seasons/the-seasons.pdf">The seasons across the Earth</a> 
* <a href="tutorials/keplers-laws/keplers-laws.pdf">Kepler's laws of orbits</a> 
* <a href="tutorials/newtons-laws-of-motion/newtons-laws-of-motion.pdf">Newton's laws of motion and gravity</a>
* <a href="tutorials/spectroscopy/spectroscopy.pdf">Spectroscopy</a>

### Labs

The lab PDF's are on the labs page.

Here's what you should know from each lab:

* Lab 1: how do stars move through the sky each day? (Same as the Celestial Sphere tutorial)
* Lab 2: how does the path of the Sun change from summer to winter at different places on Earth? (Same as the Seasons tutorial, sort of)
* Lab 3: what causes the moon phases and how do they work?
* Lab 4: how do we use "parallax" to measure distance, and what are its advantages and disadvantages of a technique to measure the distances to astronomical things?
* Lab 5: What features of the cycles in the sky have humans used to construct calendars, and what are the broad properties of different systems for doing this? (I won't ask you to remember which culture used which system.)
* Lab 6: What are the properties of Earth's orbit and the orbits of planets generally?
* Lab 7: How did humans measure the mass of the black hole at the center of the Galaxy even though we can't see it?
* Lab 8: How does the light produced by a hot object depend on its temperature; what do the spectra of different sorts of objects look like?
* Lab 9: How can we tell what chemical elements are present in things by their spectra? (Similar to the Spectroscopy tutorial)
* Lab 10: How can we estimate the temperatures of planets based on their distance from the Sun and the Sun's properties? *(We will not have you do algebra on the final exam, but you should know the approachtaken in the lab, along with the things you expect a planet's temperature to depend on.)*
* Lab 11: How does radioactive decay allow us to determine the ages of old things, like the Earth?
* Lab 12: This was a "review lab" for the whole course; it won't be on the final specifically.
