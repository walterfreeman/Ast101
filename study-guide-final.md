### Study guides

Here are the study guides for all eight units.  

Please note that these only tell you what topics are on the exam, and what material you are responsible for knowing. As you know by now, there is a difference between knowing something
and knowing how to apply it to learn something else. **You** are responsible for reviewing your 
in-class exercises and homework, making sure that you understand everything from the lab (which is not
in the study guides), and ensuring that you're well-equipped to apply this information to understand astronomy.

This is particularly true for Unit 1, which is all about geometry.
