# Study guide for Exam 2

In this unit, we studied:

* the history of how we arrived at the modern picture of the solar system
* the details of that picture (Kepler and Newton's laws)

I'll talk about each in turn. Then I'll provide for you

* some advice on how to study.

Before I do that, though, you should know that while I am very busy in the next few days, I will try to make time for questions about astronomy itself. If there is something you don't understand related to course content, ask me (in the help sessions or by email), and I'll answer as soon as I can.

## Historical outline
We studied a bunch of history, showing how we arrived at the modern picture of the Solar System. Here's an outline of the history:

* Ancient Greek thought:
	* Division between natural philosophy (seeking the truth of Nature) and astronomy (predicting the motion of things in the sky)
	* "Astronomy" looked down upon as mere number-crunching
	* Certain philosophical assumptions: Earth is at the center of everything; planets, sun, moon, stars move in circles around Earth
	* Sought natural, not supernatural, explanations for things
	* Used mathematics (particularly geometry) to make their explanations precise
* Ptolemaic model (book pp. 60-61):
	* Constrained by philosophical preconceptions: Everything moves in perfect circles with the Earth at the center
	* Big difficulty with geocentric solar system models: explain retrograde motion of the planets
	* Ptolemy's model explained this with "epicycles", smaller circular motions overlaid on the large orbit of the planet around the Earth
	* System of epicycles very complicated, but the predictions were quite accurate
	* Transmitted, refined, and used by scholars in the area, particularly the Persian and Islamic astronomers 
* Huge gap in time -- Ptolemy was in the 2nd century CE. Fast-forward to Europe in the 16th century...
* Copernicus: proposed Sun, not Earth, at the center of the solar system
	* Explained retrograde motion without recourse to epicycles
	* Much simpler
	* ... but not as accurate as Ptolemaic model
* Galileo: observed sky for the first time with a telescope
	* Saw mountains on the Moon: celestial bodies are not perfect!
	* Saw moons of Jupiter: things orbit objects other than Earth!
	* Saw phases of Venus: confirmation that the Sun is at the center!
	* Published this to great acclaim, but was accused of heresy and imprisoned in his house
* Tycho: made precision measurements of the motions of the planets
	* Observed a supernova and proved that it was far away, showing that the heavens *did* change (counter to conventional wisdom)
	* Main contribution: precision measurements to 1/30 of a degree of the motions of the planets
	* Had a model for the Solar System, but it was wrong and we don't care about it
* Kepler: used Tycho's data to finally come up with the right model
	* Planetary orbits are *ellipses*, not circles
	* Three laws of orbital motion (**this is a big deal and you should study them in depth**, in the lecture tutorials for #2 and #3 and in the book, pp 64-65). 
	* Described motions of planets almost perfectly
	* Suspected that there were more fundamental agents at work that gave rise to his laws of orbital motion, but couldn't figure out what they were 
* Newton: figured out what they were :)
	* Laws of motion: this is a big deal, pp. 88-89 of your book. Addressed in class Thursday.
	* Law of gravity: allows calculation of the gravitational force between any two objects.
	* In combination: establishes a mathematical description of *why* Kepler's laws are true in terms of more fundamental physics

## Physical principles

Many of the physics ideas appear in the historical outline as well. However, at the end of our history, we arrived at some crucial physics ideas that are in the *Lecture Tutorials*. There are two big ideas here:

* Kepler's laws of orbital motion *accurately describe* the ways the planets move
* Newton's laws of motion and of gravity give the *physical reasons* for that motion, explaining it in terms of underlying physics.
* The conservation of energy dictates that an object closer to a source of gravitational attraction has less potential
energy, and thus more kinetic energy -- and thus moves faster.

Here's an outline of each of these. 

### Kepler's laws

* Kepler's First Law: Orbits (planets, moons, anything else -- anything orbiting something else due to gravity) take the form of *ellipses*, with the Sun (or other body being orbited) at one focus of the ellipse.
	* Properties of ellipses -- fig. 3.13
* Kepler's Second Law: The line connecting the Sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
	* **Lecture Tutorials pp. 21-24 -- study this extensively**
* Kepler's Third Law: The amount of time $T$ a planet takes to orbit a star depends only on the length of the semimajor axis of its orbit $a$. In symbols, $T^2 \propto a^3$ or $T \propto a^{3/2}$. If you aren't mathematically inclined, know that as the semimajor axis of the orbit increases, the time required to orbit increases *faster*. If I multiply the axis length by 2, I multiply the time required to orbit by *more than 2*. (Actually, it's about 2.8, since $2^{3/2} \approx 2.8$.) **This is Lecture Tutorials 25-28 -- study this extensively.**

### Newton's laws of motion and of gravity

* First law of motion: an object travels in a straight line at a constant speed unless a force acts upon it.
* Second law of motion: $F=ma$ (in symbols), or $a=F/m$: a force acting on an object causes it to accelerate in that direction *proportional to* the force, and *inversely proportional* to the mass.
* Law of gravity:
	* All objects exert an attractive gravitational force on all other objects
	* If A pulls on B with some force, B pulls back on A with the same force. ("Earth's gravity pulls down on me with a force of 160 pounds; my gravity pulls back up on Earth with a force of 160 pounds as well")
	* Force is proportional to the *product* of the masses
	* Force is *inversely proportional* to the square of the distance between the objects
	* In symbols:
		* Call the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and the distance between them $r$.
		* $F_{\rm grav} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$
	* **This is a big deal -- lecture tutorials pp. 29-32.**
### Interesting consequences of Newton's laws: the conservation of energy 
* An object's total energy doesn't change throughout its orbit
* Two kinds of energy are relevant:
	* Kinetic energy, based on how fast it is moving
	* Potential energy, based on how far it is from the thing attracting it
* Their sum, total energy, is *conserved* -- thus, if you move away from the star, gaining more potential energy,
you must lose kinetic energy to compensate.
* This gives a **physics explanation** for why Kepler's second law is true: the closer a planet gets to the star, the faster it must go!

### The philosophy and process of science

* Notes coming soon -- see the slides for lecture 12 (calendar link) in the meantime

## Advice for how to study

The *Exercises* are the best source for material on Kepler's second and third laws, and Newton's law of gravity. These are the central ideas of this unit.

Also, do some background reading, especially if you learn well from books. The parts of your text you should focus on are:

* Greek thought: pp.58-59
* The Ptolemaic model: pp. 60-61
* The history from Copernicus to Kepler: pp. 61-64
* Kepler's laws: pp. 64-65. The treatment in the book is pretty superficial -- see the Lecture Tutorials for a more substantial one.
* Galileo's observations: pp. 66-67
* Newton's laws of motion: pp.87-89. We don't care about the book's description of Newton's third law (and it's a muddled description in one place, anyway!)
* Newton's law of gravity: pp. 95-99. The discussion meanders a bit here; we've not talked about energy (and it's not on the exam).

Finally, if you want to look at the lecture slides, the best thing you can do is to verify that you understand the answers to the various response-card questions. If you have questions about any of them, ask me, a clinic TA, your peers, or your lab TA.
