### Course philosophy 

#### 1. Our birthright: a beautiful Universe

Our class, more than anything else, is a story: the story of how we humans came to understand 
our place in the Universe, how that Universe works, and how we have used and can continue 
to use that knowledge to change our lives and our world for the better. Astronomy was the first
of the sciences, and the heavens were the playground where the scientific method developed.
In our class we will learn how the sky works and how we know about it, but we will also explore 
what it means for humanity: how over the last few thousand years we have gone from the Stone Age to
walking on another world and exploring the furthest reaches of the Universe with our telescopes 
and other instruments. 

It is the story of how our species has grown up and discovered that the Universe
 holds more promise for us and is more beautiful than we ever could have imagined.
And so we will study that beauty, too: how the heavens have inspired generations of 
poets, artists, dreamers, and authors.

Most of you won’t become astrophysicists; you will become designers and businessfolk, architects and reporters, doctors and lawyers, and writers and thinkers, and I hope that you will take some of the inspiration, the poetry, the philosophy, the wisdom, and the wonder of astronomy into your chosen disciplines and your lives.


<!-- Most people’s interest in astronomy begins as children, when they look up at the night sky and say “Wow, that’s gorgeous; I want to know more about that!” Or, perhaps, they watch *Star Trek* or *Battlestar Galactica* and want to know more about the universe outside our world that inspired the storytellers. The ancients’ interest in astronomy began with more pragmatic goals in mind: the night sky can be used to navigate. We’ve been to the moon, we’ve sent robots to the planets, and two lonely spacecraft are floating out to the stars, keeping in fading contact with us for the time being using the dwindling power from their plutonium-powered transmitters. Perhaps, someday, we will follow them? Regardless of the reason, astronomy has captured the imagination of humanity like no other science, and we would be amiss in our study of astronomy not to look at the broader influence that the heavens have had on the larger sweep of human imagination and thought.-->

#### 2. Reasoning and synthesis, not memorization

This course is emphatically not a class where you will come to lecture, sit there and listen to a presentation of some facts, and then repeat them back to me on exams. Rather, you will need to think about how we’ve gained the understanding that we have about our universe, and engage in scientific reasoning based on astronomical principles. You are not going to be learning a list of currently-accepted facts; you are going to be practicing skills and learning to see the universe as scientists see it. This will require hard work from you: you're going
to be *doing* and *thinking*, not just passively amassing facts. 

So, during class, you'll be spending a lot of your time *doing stuff* to learn: collaborating with people near you
in the auditorium to figure things out. We will give you copies of tutorials that guide you through developing
the skills involved in astronomy, and we will be on hand to help you as you develop your skills.

Take this seriously: it is the most important part of our class. Many of the questions on our exams will closely parallel
these exercises.

#### 3. Group work

One of the most vibrant aspects of university life is the intellectual community you form with your peers. Science, like most 
areas of human achievement, is not done by individuals working alone; it is a collaborative process.

Thus, you'll be working in groups of three in your labs. These groups will remain the same throughout the semester; we will
assign you to a lab group early in the semester and you will work with them throughout. 

During the first lab, you will work with your group to create a set of expectations for group work -- how you will work
together over the semester. 

#### 4. This is your class, too

As part of this philosophy, I welcome your input. If there is some aspect of astronomy that inspires or fascinates you, please ask; if you have feedback for me that will help you enjoy the class more, then please let me know.


<a id="health"></a>

#### What to do if you’re seriously sick
If you have an illness or injury that interferes with your ability to do work in our class, talk to us! The Center for Disability Resources also helps students with short-term injuries and illnesses -- concussions, broken bones, etc. If you are sick or hurt, we will work with you and with CDR to do whatever we can to accommodate your condition. 

If you are too sick to come to class, or have COVID-19 or another condition
that is highly contagious, we want you to focus on taking care of yourself. (The stars will still be there later.) 
Please contact the Barnes Center for advice on what to do.

If you miss a large amount of class (two weeks or more) for a reason beyond your control, you may be eligible to take an “incomplete grade” in the course.
This is a “grade pending” status that means that you were not able to finish all your work during the semester because of issues beyond your control. 
Once you finish up your work in the spring, we can go back and give you your final grade.

If you think you might need to use this option, it is important to talk to us as early as possible so we can discuss arrangements. 
In general, only students who have completed a majority of the course with a strong grade (roughly 2/3 of the course with a C+ or better)
are eligible to take an incomplete. If the issues that have taken you away from your studies have been so pervasive that you would need to repeat a significant portion
of the semester to gain the skills from our course, then it is more appropriate for you to repeat the course in another semester. 

<a id="inclusion">

### Inclusion, Equality, and Dignity
Everyone in this class is an equally-valued member of this university and our community. 
We expect you to treat your classmates and instructors as honored colleagues in the 
collective endeavor we are all involved in: to understand the natural world and 
use that understanding to improve our society. 

In particular, bias against or denigration of anyone in our class because of their gender or how they express it, their sexual orientation, their life stance, their national origin, the language they speak, 
their race or ethnicity, or a disability they may have will not be tolerated. If you are the target of this sort of bias or if you witness it, please report it directly to me and I will take swift action. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to me, you may report it anonymously to the Physics Department chair at <https://syracuseuniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9pORpTKnq6pLeyF>.

<a id="material">

### Course Material

This course focuses mostly on the astronomy of the solar system, and is divided into four broad sections:

*1.* **The changing sky:** How the motions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun cause the changes we see in the sky, including the motion of the stars, the phases of the Moon, and the changing seasons

*2.* **Astromechanics:** how we came to learn that the planets orbit the Sun, the properties of those orbits, and how this led to the origin of the scientific method and of physics

*3.* **Light:** the basic properties of light; how the light from objects depends on their temperature and composition; how the rainbow tells us the nature of the Sun

*4.* **Earth in the Universe:** the origin of Earth and the nature of the planets; climate change on Earth; the past, present, and future of spaceflight, and the possibility of life elsewhere

### Course Activities 

#### Readings

We are using a free textbook this semester, but it's actually quite good -- and not excessively long. We won't be going through the book in order; 
instead, we will jump around through topics in an order that makes more sense for our class. In some cases, I will provide you a set of notes to 
read instead, which will take the form of a "textbook-like" narrative of a topic.

I encourage you to read the assigned sections on the [calendar](./calendar.html) ahead of time, as that way the presentation of the material in class will serve as reinforcement and enrichment rather than be the first time you see something. 

#### Class Meetings

Tuesdays and Thursdays we will meet in the auditorium. We'll alternate between presenting material and doing things with it. 
I want to avoid a "static" lecture as much as possible, and I want to hear your ideas as much as possible during class. 

So, during class, I will frequently ask your thoughts on things. Sometimes that will take the form of an informal conversation. 
Feel free to raise your hands and ask me things. We will also have "poll" questions in class, which you can answer using multiple-choice
cards.

#### Tutorials

We will also use a substantial amount of class time in the auditorium for you to work on tutorials: sets of exercises that help you develop the skills we
are discussing. These will be the most useful things for you to develop the skills you'll need for the quizzes, and so you should do them
in class and ask questions as you get stuck with things. The coaches and I will circulate around and help you out.

This is the most important part of our course. These tutorials are where you will practice the technical skills that we expect you to learn in our
class; our homework and exam questions will often closely resemble the things in the tutorials, so you should take time to make sure you understand
the things in them. If you still have questions, please ask in class or in the Physics Clinic.

#### Homework

There will be a brief homework set attached to many of the tutorials you do in class. They are designed to be done in sequence; 
we expect that you will finish the tutorial in class, and then work on the homework at home. When we don't have a tutorial in class,
we may have standalone homework for you to do.

Your homework will not be collected. Instead, the weekly online quizzes will reference your homework and ask questions about it.

#### Weekly quizzes

We will have weekly online quizzes which you will complete on Blackboard. These will be most directly related to your homework, but may also
tie together things from lecture and lab.

#### Exams

We will have three midterm exams on each of the first three units and a final exam. 
These exams will be multiple choice and will cover things from lecture, the tutorials and homework, and the labs. 

#### Paper 

During the semester you will write a paper that explores the scientific process and discusses what scientific thought is and what it is not.

One of your labs will be a writing workshop where you work with your group to create an outline sketch of the story you will tell and the
the claims that you will make in your paper.

#### Labs
<a id="labs"></a>
AST101 satisfies the laboratory course requirement of the liberal arts core and so it has a lab component.
We expect you to attend your lab section every week, and many important course activities take place in the laboratories. 

There is also a take-home lab that you will complete with your lab group.
Because the labs are a crucial element of the course, no student may receive a final grade for the course more than one letter grade
above their lab average. (That is, if you get a D average for the lab, the highest grade you can get for the class is a C.)

Your lab grade will reflect both your learning and participation while in lab and the quality of the work you submit. 
The point of the lab portion of the class is to learn by doing; it is not to "get the right answers". 
Your grade is based on your understanding of what is going on *as reflected by* what you turn in; 
it is not based only on a mechanical evaluation of whether you "wrote down the right answers or not".

The lab attendance policy is as follows:

* You must have completed the prelab before coming to your lab. 
* You must attend the lab section that you registered for. 
  * If you anticipate regular conflicts with your scheduled lab time (for instance, if you have registered for a Friday lab but you are on an athletics team that regularly is on the road on Fridays), please switch your enrollment to another lab section.
* If it is necessary for you to attend a different lab section than you are enrolled in:
  * Contact the TA of another lab section at a time you can attend and ask if they have space
  * If they do, inform your TA that you will be attending their section instead that week, and tell them the reason for your absence
  * Contact your lab group and inform them that you will be absent. (You do not need to tell them why.)
* Once during the semester, you may switch lab sections for any reason (including not having completed your prelab). 
* If it is necessary for you to switch your lab section more than once, all of those switches must correspond to University-excused absences (see below). 
* You should come to lab on time. TA's may at their discretion ask students to come to another section if they arrive for lab more than ten minutes late.

##### Lab Schedule

We will begin labs during the week of Labor Day during the second week of class. Since there are no classes Monday, this means that the lab week
will start on Tuesday and end on Monday (so that students in Monday labs will be the *last* students to complete any given lab, rather than the *first*).

We will adjust this in the middle of the semester by omitting one lab from the Monday rotation. After this, the lab week will start on Monday and end on Friday.
Students enrolled in Monday labs will complete this omitted lab at the end of the semester.

---

### Grading

Your grade will be based on the following items. Due dates for these things may change slightly as the semester elapses.

| Item                     |            Date        | Points (approximate)      |
|--------------------------|:----------------------:|--------------------------:|
| Weekly Quizzes           | Throughout             | 10 each; about 140 total  |
| Exam 1                   |                        | about 100                 |
| Exam 2                   |                        | about 100                 |
| Exam 3                   |                        | about 100                 |
| Final Exam               |                        | about 150                 |
| Paper                    |                        | 80                        |
| Labs                     | Throughout the semester| 25 each; about 275 total  |
| Group Evaluation         | End of the semester    | 40                        |
|--------------------------|:----------------------:|--------------------------:|

There are no further weights for these items; one point is worth one point, regardless of where it came from.

We will not count your lowest weekly quiz grade, your lowest lab, or your lowest exam grade. This policy is not to
allow you to skip a lab, exam, or quiz; it is to accommodate students who must miss a lab or assessment when 
calculating grades. 

The sum of the points you have earned will be converted to a percentage of the total and your final grade will be determined as follows:

* 88-100: A
*  80-88: A-
*  75-80: B+
*  70-75: B
*  65-70: B-
*  62-65: C+
*  58-62: C
*  55-58: C-
*  50-55: D
*   0-50: F

**Note that this is a different grading scale than the common one used in American high schools**. I will ask you to do challenging things in this class; I am aware of that, and do not expect everyone to be able to do everything perfectly.

#### Requests for Academic Accommodation

Students often have other events in their lives that conflict with their studies. It is our goal to give students an opportunity to learn even if they must miss class occasionally,
and to give students a way to be evaluated on their knowledge and ability despite these conflicts. However, because of the large number of students in this class, we are unable
to provide *ad hoc* academic accommodations or to make our own judgments about whether any given event should or should not take precedence over our class's activities. 
For fairness, we must establish a policy that applies uniformly to everyone, and defer to other University offices about whether particular absences have the University's sanction
since we do not have the perspective or resources to judge which absences should be excused.

We will omit your lowest quiz grade, lab grade, and midterm exam grade regardless of situation.
We will also allow everyone to switch lab sections once during the semester regardless of reason. We anticipate that this policy will cover most circumstances. 
Beyond this, our policy is to offer the following accommodations in class attendance:

**Labs:**

* You may attend a different lab section than the one you are registered for once during the semester for any reason, as detailed above
* If you miss multiple labs, we will omit up to three lab grades only if:
  * You missed every one of those labs for university-sanctioned or university-excused reasons
  * You were unable to attend a lab section at any time later in the week because of university-sanctioned absences or conflicts with other courses
  * If you knew in advance that your lab section would conflict with other commitments, you made an effort to enroll for a lab section that would not have such conflicts. (For instance, if you will regularly be participating in NCAA-sponsored athletics on Thursdays and/or Fridays, or have a recurring medical appointment, you should enroll in a lab section that meets at another time.)

**Quizzes:**

Our weekly quizzes will be available to you online for at least three days. We will allow you to take 
up to three missed quizzes up to a week after your return from a University-sanctioned absence (for instance, illness or injury)
if you were unable to complete the quiz during the period when the it was available.

**Midterm Exams:**

If you are unable to take two midterm exams, we will replace both of your missed exam grades with your percentage grade on the final exam. 
We will do this only if both of your exam absences were for university-sanctioned reasons.

If you miss an exam due to NCAA-sponsored athletics-related travel, you may take the exam on the road so long as:

* A team official is available to print the exam for you, sit with you while you take the exam, and send me a record of your answers
* You begin the exam between two hours before and twelve hours after the time that the class starts the exam

**Final Exam:**

If you are unable to take the final exam due to a University-sanctioned absence (such as illness or injury), 
we will give you an opportunity to make up the final exam. We expect you to do this as soon as possible after you return.
Note that we will not arrange online final exams for students who leave Syracuse for break early. 

**Exam Scheduling for Students with Disabilities:**

Students who receive extended time from the Center for Disability Resources on exams should schedule to take their exams as soon as practical
with CDR. Note that:

* You may not *finish* your exam at CDR before the rest of the class has *begun* to take it
* We will not require you to miss other classes to make use of your extended time at CDR
* You should schedule your exam as soon as practical after the nominal time of the exam, but may do so on the following day if necessary
* If you take an exam on a different day than scheduled, it is your responsibility to email me when you are done so I can pick up your exam paper for grading

**University-Sanctioned Absences:**

An absence is university-sanctioned if:

* The Barnes Center or Student Outreach and Retention sends me a notice requesting accommodations for you on the specific date of the absence
* You are receiving medical treatment at the time of the absence (documented either by the Barnes Center or by your provider)
* A NCAA-affiliated athletics team sends me a notice requesting accommodations for you on the date of the absence
* Another University-related organization (for instance, the marching band or ROTC cadre) requests accommodations for you
* You have registered a religious observance with the University 
* You are attending an academic conference related to your studies

**Incompletes:**

The University allows us to give students a final grade with an "incomplete" tag. This indicates that a student has not finished all of their work, but has
an arrangement with a professor to complete that work after the semester has closed and receive a higher grade once it is complete.

This arrangement is not designed to allow students to "make up" large portions of a course, no matter how justified the reason for their absence. In that
event, the appropriate thing is to retake the course. (Note that Syracuse University automatically uses only the highest grade for students who take courses
more than once.)

We will make "incomplete" arrangements only if:

* You have missed up to three weeks of our course or missed the final exam for an extended University-sanctioned absence
* You have contacted Student Outreach and Retention about your situation and they agree an incomplete is appropriate
* Your grade on the portion of the course you have completed is C+ or better
* You notify us of the situation as soon as possible upon your return to class, rather than waiting until the end of the semester


#### Papers 

The paper will be graded out of 80 points, although there is no fixed maximum value for your grade; exceptional work will get substantial extra credit.

The grading rubric for the paper will be explained in depth as part of the assignment when we present it to you.


<a id="policy"></a>

### Academic integrity

Our university's motto is "Suos cultores scientia coronat" -- "knowledge crowns those who seek her". Our class's theme is a variant on this: "Science allows us to
write our own future." The most valuable thing you will gain from your education here isn't a degree or a bunch of marks on your transcript: 
it is the power to influence your world that you will gain from the things you learn.

As such, if you pass off someone else's work as your own in this class, you are depriving yourself of of the value of education itself. 
This class is designed so that any student who works hard and keeps up will pass. 
You do not need to substitute someone else's work or knowledge for your own; your own talents, your own skill, and your own work are enough. 

While you are encouraged to discuss everything in the course with your peers, all work you submit must reflect your own understanding and
be a product of your own effort. We may impose a grade sanction up to course failure for any instance of academic dishonesty. 
Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy governs general expectations for students and is incorporated into this syllabus by reference. 

On your weekly quizzes, you may consult any references you wish as long as you are doing this to gain understanding rather than to 
copy answers. (For instance, you may read Wikipedia articles, Google things, talk to your classmates, consult your textbook, etc.,
but you may not solicit answers to copy.) 

In your paper, you must show clearly which text is original to you,
which reflects ideas which you found elsewhere but have expressed with original rhetoric, 
and which text is a direct quote from someone else’s words.
You must cite any references that you use. (You do not need to cite anything from the course textbook, notes, or lectures.)
If you consult a webpage or book for information, you should tell us this. We don’t care what citation style you use.

Direct quotes must be indicated. This is done by either blockquoting the other writer’s text or by putting it in quotation marks. In general, however, you should use direct quotes only sparingly in your writing.

**A note on "paraphrasing"**: You should never take the organization and content of someone else’s writing 
and merely replace words with synonyms, reorder words, omit sentences or phrases, etc. This is called "substitution plagiarism".
If you do wish to use someone else's rhetoric, then quote the original author's words directly and attribute the quote.
If you want to use their ideas, then read what they have written and describe their ideas using your own logic, rhetoric, and organization.


### Students with disabilities and other access challenges
Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course, please contact us to discuss accommodations we can make to ensure that the class is accessible to you, or collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process.

If you would like to discuss disability-related accommodations with CDR, please visit their website at disabilityservices.syr.edu, visit them in person in Room 309 of 8047 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498, TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible.

CDR coordinates academic accommodations to students who have short-term illnesses (physical or mental). If you are injured or ill and need academic accommodations beyond short-term due date extensions for AST101, we will likely design those accommodations for you in collaboration with CDR.

### Copyright

All materials that we have developed this class are the copyright of their authors, but we do not intend to restrict their use; anyone may use them under the Creative Commons cc-by-nc-sa license, which gives you the right to share our materials freely or adapt them so long as you credit their authors, do not use them for commercial purposes, and require that anyone else distributing them also license them under these same terms.

You are free to record class for your personal use but those recordings are not included in this license; 
those may not be distributed outside of our class without our permission to protect students’ freedom of expression in class.

Note that uploading materials to Chegg, CourseHero, or similar websites constitutes commercial use and is thus not allowed.

### Solemn observances 

*(The following is common to all SU classes)*

SU’s religious observances notification and policy, found at http://hendricks.syr.edu/spiritual-life/index.html, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented among the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holidays according to their tradition. Under the policy, students are provided an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance provided they notify their instructors before the end of the second week of classes. An online notification process is available for students in My Slice / StudentServices / Enrollment / MyReligiousObservances / Add a Notification.

Events of equal solemnity to major religious observances, occurring on inflexible dates, will be given the same deference as religious observances. This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of immediate family members, funerals, caregiving duties for sick family members, other family emergencies or singularly-important events, job interviews, and the like.

Likewise, you may have conflicts between elements of our course and other University-sponsored activities or other activities of an academic nature (for instance, NCAA athletics or travel to an academic conference).
These events will be given the same deference, as will participation in political or social activism occurring on inflexible dates or in response to ongoing circumstances – attending a demonstration, canvassing for a campaign, 
serving as a poll worker, or the like.

If you must miss your lab because of a solemn observance, social or political activism, illness or injury, or academic or university-sanctioned conflict, 
please discuss this with your group and arrange to attend at a different time that week. 

If you miss an exam for such a reason, then we will replace that exam grade with the average of other exam grades.
