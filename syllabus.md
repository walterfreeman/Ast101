### Who's who

There are a lot of people teaching this class; who are they?

#### The professor
Walter is in charge of giving the lectures, writing materials, helping students in any way I can (with my class or anything else!), supervising grading, and leading the course as a whole.

If you want to talk to me, come to ioffice hours or catch me before or after class. I am also
frequently on the Discord server.

You can also email me about private issues at <wafreema@syr.edu>. 

Contact Walter if:

* You have a question about astronomy (or anything else!)
* You have a suggestion that will improve your experience in the course as a whole or the lecture portion specifically
* Something is badly wrong in your lab that your TA can’t fix, or that you don’t feel comfortable discussing with them
* You will miss a large amount of work
* You need high-level assistance with anything in our class or at the university

#### The TA's
The lab teaching assistants are PhD students in physics who work as junior instructors as part of their training. 
They are in charge of leading labs and helping grade your work. You can contact them by email, by going to
their office hours in the Physics Clinic, or by simply talking to them during lab.

Contact your TA if:
* You have a question about astronomy
* You have a suggestion that will improve their lab, or that you want them to pass on to me
* Something is wrong with your grade
* You will miss a lab
* The people in your lab group are not working together effectively

#### The coaches
The coaches are undergraduate students like yourself who took this class in the past and who will be helping you
during lecture, occasionally during lab, and over the internet and the Discord server.

You can contact them by talking to them during class or lab or on Discord.

Talk to the undergraduate coaches if:
* You have a question about the tutorials in class, your homework, or your paper
* You want advice on studying, writing your paper, or anything else!

#### A note on email

We will receive prodigious amounts of email this semester and will sometimes get behind on answering mail. Please help us out! There are a few things you can do:

1. If you have a question that might apply to other students and are on Discord, please ask there instead of sending it as an email. You will get a quicker answer there, and other people will benefit.

2. When you email us, please include a meaningful subject line in your message telling us what it is about; don’t write “Astronomy 101”, since almost all of the mail I get is about Astronomy 101, and that doesn’t help! Also don't use a subject line of "Lab" -- tell me what your issue is with your lab!

We will try to answer all messages that need a reply within 24 hours. 
If you don’t get a reply after two days, but your message needs a reply, please just send us your message again to remind us. (We get a lot of mail and
we sometimes get behind.) In particular, on the day of an exam, I am only able to answer the most urgent emails.

### Course philosophy 

#### 1. Our birthright: a beautiful Universe

Our class, more than anything else, is a story: the story of how we humans came to understand 
our place in the Universe, how that Universe works, and how we have used and can continue 
to use that knowledge to change our lives and our world for the better. Astronomy was the first
of the sciences, and the heavens were the playground where the scientific method developed.
In our class we will learn how the sky works and how we know about it, but we will also explore 
what it means for humanity: how over the last few thousand years we have gone from the Stone Age to
walking on another world and exploring the furthest reaches of the Universe. 

It is the story of how our species has grown up and discovered that the Universe
 holds more promise for us and is more beautiful than we ever could have imagined.
And so we will study that beauty, too: how the heavens have inspired generations of 
poets, artists, dreamers, and authors.

Most of you won’t become astrophysicists; you will become designers and businessfolk, architects and reporters, doctors and lawyers, and writers and thinkers, and I hope that you will take some of the inspiration, the poetry, the philosophy, the wisdom, and the wonder of astronomy into your chosen disciplines and your lives.


<!-- Most people’s interest in astronomy begins as children, when they look up at the night sky and say “Wow, that’s gorgeous; I want to know more about that!” Or, perhaps, they watch *Star Trek* or *Battlestar Galactica* and want to know more about the universe outside our world that inspired the storytellers. The ancients’ interest in astronomy began with more pragmatic goals in mind: the night sky can be used to navigate. We’ve been to the moon, we’ve sent robots to the planets, and two lonely spacecraft are floating out to the stars, keeping in fading contact with us for the time being using the dwindling power from their plutonium-powered transmitters. Perhaps, someday, we will follow them? Regardless of the reason, astronomy has captured the imagination of humanity like no other science, and we would be amiss in our study of astronomy not to look at the broader influence that the heavens have had on the larger sweep of human imagination and thought.-->

#### 2. Reasoning and synthesis, not memorization

This course is emphatically not a class where you will come to lecture, sit there and listen to a presentation of some facts, and then repeat them back to me on exams. Rather, you will need to think about how we’ve gained the understanding that we have about our universe, and engage in scientific reasoning based on astronomical principles. You are not going to be learning a list of currently-accepted facts; you are going to be practicing skills and learning to see the universe as scientists see it. This will require hard work from you: you're going
to be *doing* and *thinking*, not just passively amassing facts. 

So, during class, you'll be spending a lot of your time *doing stuff* to learn: collaborating with people near you
in the auditorium to figure things out. We will give you copies of tutorials that guide you through developing
the skills involved in astronomy, and I and the coaches will be on hand to help you as you develop your skills.

Take this seriously: it is the most important part of our class.

<!-- #### 3. Group work


One of the most vibrant aspects of university life is the intellectual community you form with your peers. In normal circumstances this sort of community forms naturally, as you become friends and colleagues with the people around you in your classes. This semester, this sort of community will be even more important (as you support each other through a difficult time), but harder to maintain (since you will often be online). 

Thus, we will be more deliberate than we usually are in providing a structure for this community to you. We will assign you to groups and expect you to work together with the folks in your group on our class. You should get to know them, exchange contact information, and establish a means of working together that works well for the three of you. 

We expect everyone to contribute in their groups. Part of your grade will be based on your groupmates' evaluation of you. Likewise, the things that your group creates will be read by other groups. Your projects aren't just a way for
you to demonstrate what you know; they're a way for you to create things that other people in our class will
learn from. Their evaluations will be part of your grade, and the grade that they give you will be based not
just on whether your work is correct but whether they could learn from it.

You will be vital supports to each other in both learning our material and during this weird semester as a whole. Our class is full of friendly people; become friends with them! A part of your grade will come from how effectively your group works together, and you will assess that yourselves. 

If there is a problem with how your group is collaborating -- if one person is not making any effort, or if one person is not collaborating well with the others -- then please tell your TA. These sorts of issues will both make the class a lot less enjoyable and interfere with your learning, but they can be fixed. Let us know, and we will fix them.
--> 

#### 4. This is your class, too

As part of this philosophy, I welcome your input. If there is some aspect of astronomy that inspires or fascinates you, please ask; if you have feedback for me that will help you enjoy the class more, then please let me know.>>

#### What to do if you’re seriously sick
If you have an illness or injury that interferes with your ability to do work in our class, talk to us! The Center for Disability Resources also helps students with short-term injuries and illnesses -- concussions, broken bones, etc. If you are sick or hurt, we will work with you and with CDR to do whatever we can to accommodate your condition. 

If you are too sick to come to class, or have COVID-19 or another condition
that is highly contagious, we want you to focus on taking care of yourself. (The stars will still be there later.) 
Please contact the Barnes Center for advice; they will send me a note saying that you are sick.

If you miss a large amount of class (two weeks or more) for a reason beyond your control, you may be eligible to take an “incomplete grade” in the course.
This is a “grade pending” status that means that you were not able to finish all your work during the semester. Once you finish up your work in the spring, we can go back and give you your final grade.

If you think you might need to use this option, it is important to talk to us as early as possible so we can discuss arrangements. 
In general, only students who have completed a meaningful amount of classwork with a strong grade are eligible to take an incomplete.

<a id="inclusion">

### Inclusion, Equality, and Dignity
Everyone in this class is an equally-valued member of this university and our community. 
We expect you to treat your classmates and instructors as honored colleagues in the 
collective endeavor we are all involved in: to understand the natural world and 
use that understanding to improve our society. 

In particular, bias against or denigration of anyone in our class because of their gender or how they express it, their sexual orientation, their life stance, their national origin, the language they speak, 
their race or ethnicity, or a disability they may have will not be tolerated. If you are the target of this sort of bias or if you witness it, please report it directly to me and I will take swift action. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to me, you may report it anonymously to the Physics Department chair at <https://syracuseuniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9pORpTKnq6pLeyF>.

<a id="material">

### Course Material

This course focuses mostly on the astronomy of the solar system, and is divided into four broad sections:

*1.* **The changing sky:** How the motions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun cause the changes we see in the sky, including the motion of the stars, the phases of the Moon, and the changing seasons

*2.* **Astromechanics:** how we came to learn that the planets orbit the Sun, the properties of those orbits, and how this led to the origin of the scientific method and of physics

*3.* **Light:** the basic properties of light; how the light from objects depends on their temperature and composition; how the rainbow tells us the nature of the Sun

*4.* **Earth in the Universe:** the origin of Earth and the nature of the planets; climate change on Earth; the past, present, and future of spaceflight, and the possibility of life elsewhere

### Learning Objectives

A more detailed version of the <a href="learning-objectives.html">learning objectives for this class</a> is on a separate page.

### Course Activities 

#### Readings

We are using a free textbook this semester, but it's actually quite good -- and not excessively long. We won't be going through the book in order; 
instead, we will jump around through topics in an order that makes more sense for our class. 

I encourage you to read the assigned sections on the [calendar](./calendar.html) ahead of time, as that way the presentation of the material in class will serve as reinforcement and enrichment rather than be the first time you see something. 

#### Class Meetings

Tuesdays and Thursdays we will meet in the auditorium. We'll alternate between presenting material and doing things with it. 
I want to avoid a "static" lecture as much as possible, and I want to hear your ideas as much as possible during class. 

So, during class, I will frequently ask your thoughts on things. Sometimes that will take the form of an informal conversation. 
Feel free to raise your hands and ask me things. We will also have "poll" questions in class, which you can answer using multiple-choice
cards.

Additionally, coaches and I will be keeping an eye on the Discord chat during class. If you'd rather ask things on Discord instead of 
calling them out in the auditorium, please do that. However, note that I will often defer logistical questions that don't pertain to
the whole class until afterwards, and answer them then. (This is to be considerate of the rest of the class, since otherwise they would
have to wait while I discussed something with you that doesn't relate to them.)

#### Tutorials

We will also use a substantial amount of class time in the auditorium for you to work on tutorials: sets of exercises that help you develop the skills we
are discussing. These will be the most useful things for you to develop the skills you'll need for the quizzes, and so you should do them
in class and ask questions as you get stuck with things. The coaches and I will circulate around and help you out.

This is the most important part of our course. These tutorials are where you will practice the technical skills that we expect you to learn in our
class; our homework and exam questions will often closely resemble the things in the tutorials, so you should take time to make sure you understand
the things in them. If you still have questions, please ask in class or in the Physics Clinic.

#### Homework

There will be a brief homework set attached to many of the tutorials you do in class. They are designed to be done in sequence; 
we expect that you will finish the tutorial in class, and then work on the homework at home. Instead of turning in homework, we
will have brief "homework quizzes" in class: on the day the homework is due, we will give you a short quiz that will be very 
similar to what you did on your homework. 

#### Exams

We will have three midterm exams on each of the first three units and a final exam. These exams will be partly multiple choice and 
partly free-response, and will cover things from lecture, the tutorials and homework, and the labs.


#### Paper and Project

Throughout the semester you will write a paper and complete an open-ended project. 
These will focus on the connections between astronomy and the broader study of the humanities; astronomy is likely the scientific discipline that has
both exerted the greatest influence on, and been influenced the most by, the broader story of human intellect and philosophy.

# * First paper: an exploration of the connection between timekeeping and the sky, as embodied in a historical, present, or fictional calendar 
* Your paper is an exploration of the nature of science, and a discussion of what scientific thought is and what it is not
* Your final project is extremely open-ended, and is an opportunity for you to connect your talents and interests outside astronomy to the scientific world

Some of you, at some point in the semester, will probably ask me for extra credit. **This is it**; these will be graded out of ten points, but there is no limit on the grade you can achieve. 

#### Labs
<a id="labs"></a>
AST101 satisfies the laboratory course requirement of the liberal arts core and so it has a lab component.
Many important course activities take place in the laboratories, and so attendance at the lab sections is required. 
There are also two take-home labs that you will complete with your lab group.
Because the labs are a crucial element of the course, no student may receive a final grade for the course more than one letter grade
above their lab average. (That is, if you get a D average for the lab, the highest grade you can get for the class is a C.)

Your lab grade will reflect both your learning and participation while in lab and the quality of the work you submit. 

Note that the point of the lab portion of the class is to learn by doing; it is not to "get the right answers". 
Your grade is based on your understanding of what is going on *as reflected by* what you turn in; it is not based only on a mechanical evaluation of whether you "wrote down the right answers or not".
In the past we have had some students who copied lab answers from students in other sections or the internet. This is a serious sort of academic dishonesty that will
result in you failing the course (or worse).

The lab attendance policy is as follows:

* You must have completed the prelab to attend lab. If you have not, then you will need to use your "one unexcused swap" to attend a different lab 
section that week.
* You should attend lab at the time that you registered for. If you aren't able to attend lab at that time, you should:
  * Contact the TA of another lab section at a time you can attend and ask if they have space
  * If they do, inform your TA that you will be attending their section instead that week
  * You may do this only once during the semester for an unexcused reason (including not having your prelab done). If you must miss lab for an illness or emergency, this does not count.
* You should come to lab on time.

We're very willing to work with and around problems that you may encounter in helping you succeed in our 
class; please let us know if something is going on that requires special accommodations. However, by default, this is the expectation.

|--------------------------|:----------------------:|-----------------:|

This set of items totals 130 points. 

Your score will be converted to a percentage and your final grade will be determined from your score as follows:

* 88-100: A
* 80-88: A-
* 75-80: B+
* 70-75: B
* 65-70: B-
* 62-65: C+
* 58-62: C
* 55-58: C-
* 50-55: D
* 0-50: F

**Note that this is a different grading scale than the common one used in American high schools**. I will ask you to do challenging things in this class; I am aware of that, and do not expect everyone to be able to do everything perfectly.

#### Papers 

The papers will be graded out of ten points, although there is no fixed maximum value for your grade; exceptional work will get substantial extra credit. (Both Dr. Freeman and the lab TA's will be helping grade the papers.)
We will be grading on the basis of:

* astronomical insight and factual correctness
* clarity of writing, including correct use of astronomical terminology. Note that we will not penalize students for spelling or minor grammar issues, and will be particularly lenient to students who have not lived for long in an English-speaking country. I’m more interested in whether your ideas fit together to tell a coherent story.
* ambition and creativity
* **We are not looking for perfection; we are looking for insight.** I am aware that many of you speak English as a second language. Don’t worry about your English skills; I want to know what you think. If you need help with your writing, we have 
multiple resources available for you -- the Writing Center, and a few coaches who have specialized skills in helping students with their writing.

<a id="policy"></a>

### Academic integrity

Our university's motto is "Suos cultores scientia coronat" -- "knowledge crowns those who seek her". Our class's theme is a variant on this: "Science allows us to
write our own future." The most valuable thing you will gain from your education here isn't a degree or a bunch of marks on your transcript: it is the power to influence your world that you will gain from the things you learn.

As such, if you pass off someone else's work as your own in this class, you are cheating yourself out of the value of education itself. 
This class is designed so that any student who works hard and keeps up will pass. 
You do not need to substitute someone else's work or knowledge for your own; your own talents, your own skill, and your own work are enough. 

While you are encouraged to discuss everything in the course with your peers, 
all work you submit must reflect your own understanding. 
We may impose a grade sanction up to course failure for any instance of academic dishonesty. 
Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy governs general expectations for students and is incorporated into this syllabus by reference. 

For your homework quizzes, you may use your homework as reference, so long as you did your homework yourself. If you have a disability that interferes with 
this, you may prepare your homework using a computer, so long as you do it yourself. 

In your writing for this class, you must show clearly which text is original to you, which reflects ideas which you found elsewhere but have digested and expressed in your own words, and which text is a direct quote from someone else’s words.
You must cite any references that you use. (You do not need to cite anything from the course textbook, notes, or lectures.) 
If you consult a webpage or book for information, you should tell us this. We don’t care what citation style you use.

Direct quotes must be indicated. This is done by either blockquoting the other writer’s text or by putting it in quotation marks. In general, however, you should use direct quotes only sparingly in your writing.

**A note on "paraphrasing"**: Taking the organization and content of someone else’s writing and merely replacing words with synonyms, reordering words, omitting sentences or phrases, etc., is never a good idea. This is called "substitution plagiarism". 
If you want to use someone else's rhetoric, then quote it directly and attribute the quote.
If you want to use their ideas, then read what they have written and describe their ideas using your own logic, rhetoric, and organization.


**A note on Chegg and similar platforms:** You are not allowed to post any materials from our class to Chegg’s “ask an expert” platform or any similar platform soliciting solutions to copy. Our experience has shown that these platforms are overwhelmingly used for academic dishonesty, i.e. to copy things without doing the work or understanding the process. 
Instead, you should collaborate with your classmates or ask one of your instructors for help. The best way to do this is to talk to us during class or 
on Discord. 
We will almost certainly be more helpful than anonymous people over the internet in helping you learn the material and gain skills and understanding. 
It is an extremely serious breach of academic integrity to solicit or use solutions from Chegg or similar, 
at <a href="http://disabilityservices.syr.edu">disabilityservices.syr.edu</a>, located in Room 309 of 8047 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498, TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations and will issue students with documented Disabilities Accommodation Authorization Letters, as appropriate. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible.

**CDR also helps students with short-term injuries**. If you have a concussion, a broken hand, or the like, *please let us know* so we can help you.

More generally, if there is anything I can do to help you, whether it is related to a disability, a medical condition, or anything else, please let me know. I have an excellent working relationship with CDR and will do anything in my power to make your experience in my class a good one.

### Solemn observances 

*(The following is common to all SU classes)*

SU’s religious observances notification and policy, found at http://hendricks.syr.edu/spiritual-life/index.html, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented among the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holidays according to their tradition. Under the policy, students are provided an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance provided they notify their instructors before the end of the second week of classes. An online notification process is available for students in My Slice / StudentServices / Enrollment / MyReligiousObservances / Add a Notification.

*(The following is specific to my classes)*

Events of equal solemnity to major religious observances, occurring on inflexible dates, will be given the same deference as religious observances. This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of immediate family members, funerals, caregiving duties for sick family members, other family emergencies or singularly-important events, job interviews, and the like.

Participation in political or social activism occurring on inflexible dates or in response to ongoing circumstances – attending a demonstration, canvassing for a campaign, 
serving as a poll worker, or the like – will be given this same deference.

If you must miss your lab because of a solemn observance, social or political activism, illness or injury, or academic conflict, please discuss this with your group and arrange to attend at a different time that week. 

If you miss an exam for such a reason, then we will arrange an alternate opportunity for you to demonstrate proficiency on that material.
