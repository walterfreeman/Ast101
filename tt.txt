In light of recent developments on campus, I am making some optional changes to the syllabus at the end of the term to allow students to focus more on any activism or to support themselves and others.

To be clear, these modifications are things that can only benefit you.

* The final exam is partially optional. It will now be treated as two parts:

* The first part will be around 30 questions on Unit 4; it will be worth the same as the others. If this is your lowest exam grade, it can be dropped, just like the others.

* The second part will consist of around 12 questions from each of our three previous units. If you score _better_ on any of these subparts than you did on the previous exam on that material, then that grade will earn you points back on your previous exams. 
If you score _worse_ on any of these subparts, or 
elect not to take them, then they will not affect your grade.

For instance, suppose that a student did poorly on Exam 1, did better on Exam 2, and did very well on Exam 3. They may choose to study Unit 1 extensively in the hopes of raising that grade, not study Units 2 and 3, and then study Unit 4. When they come to the final,
they might take only the Unit 4 exam (counts as a normal exam) and Unit 1.

* The total amount of weight allotted to exams in your final grade will not change.

* The take-home lab can be dropped as your lowest lab grade, like the others.

---

* Your final project is optional. If you do not do a final project, its weight will be reallocated among all other components of the course. (This will likely on average be slightly detrimental to your grade, since final project grades
tend to run slightly below other things.) If you *do* complete a final project, it will likely help you (and, if you do something excellent, possibly help you a great deal).
