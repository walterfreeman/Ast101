## Writing Assignment 1: Calendars and the Sky

**tl;dr: I want you to write some stuff about how the sky is related to the way humans (or hobbits or aliens) keep time. It's due October 1 at 5PM. But you should read all of this, since it has important information.**

---

### The assignment

Choose a historical or fictional culture which had a reasonably sophisticated way of reckoning time: a calendar. Some possible suggestions: the Julian calendar (of the Romans, named after Julius Caesar); the traditional Chinese calendar; any of the Hindu calendars of India; 
any of the Buddhist calendars used in Southeast Asia; the Hijra calendar (used by many Muslims); the Hebrew calendar; the Korean calendar; any of the traditional Japanese calendars; the ancient Egyptian calendar; the traditional Ethiopian calendar;
the pagan/neopagan Wheel of the Year; the Zoroastrian calendar. If you choose Mayan calendar, be aware that it is somewhat complicated, and there is only speculation as to what the tzolk'in might be used for. Give me that speculation and discuss its astronomical implications.

If you have a background in a culture that uses a different calendar from the Gregorian calendar, you may write about your own culture's calendar (and teach me something I didn't know!)

Alternatively, you may choose to write about the reckoning of time used in any major work of speculative fiction (science fiction, fantasy). Possible choices include:

* the calendar used by the Hobbits in *Lord of the Rings*, detailed in the appendices to *Return of the King* (I can get you a copy if you don't have one, but I can't post it here). 
* *Game of Thrones*. See below.
* Any other work of fiction you are familiar with that takes place on a non-Earth cosmology. There are likely some very interesting calendars used in science fiction settings involving interplanetary/interstellar travel.
* the concept of "astrological ages"; do they themselves form a very long calendar?

You should **see the section on specific calendars**, at the bottom, for some modifications to the assignment depending on your choice.

For example, the **Gregorian calendar**, the calendar we use, has the following properties:

* The smallest unit of time on the calendar is the *solar day*, judged by the motion of the Sun in the sky
* We also have the *month* and the *week*, which are based on the Moon. The month is an approximation (but is not exact!) of how long it takes the Moon to cycle through its phases; the week is an approximation (better, but still not exact) of the amount of time it takes the moon to make a quarter-phase.
* The week is partially based on the Judeo-Christian religious tradition, which indicates that we should work and rest in seven-day cycles.
* The year is the solar year, based on the solstices and equinoxes. 
* These things don't quite line up. There isn't an integer number of solar days in a solar year, so we need leap years. There isn't an integer number of lunar cycles in a solar cycle, so our months are not exact. Finally, a lunar month isn't exactly 28 solar days, so the week is not quite one-quarter of a 
lunar cycle.
* We give a great deal of precedence to the cycles of the Sun, reckoning dates only by their distance from the solstices and equinoxes, and do not really care about the cycles of the Moon that much. That is, a holiday falling on December 25 will reliably occur 3-4 day after the Winter Solstice. There is no 
attempt to make the lunar cycles line up with the solar ones.

### So, what do I want you to do?

Write a short essay of at least a single-spaced page in 12-point font (or two double-spaced pages) about how your calendar relates to the sky. You should address:

* how the calendar you have chosen is connected to the motion of the Sun, the stars, the Moon, and anything else of note. How and how well do they line up with the days, months, years, or whatever else the calendar has. 
Which motions in the sky are treated as more important, and which are treated as less important?
* how your calendar accounts for the fact that the Earth's rotation, the Earth's orbit, and the Moon's orbit don't synch up well. I described what effects this has in the Gregorian calendar above; tell me about the one you have chosen.
* any "intercalary months" or leap-whatevers needed to keep your calendar in sync with the various celestial cycles, why they are needed, and how they work
* what celestial events your calendar's reckoning predicts exactly, and which ones are only approximate (for instance, the winter solstice is sometimes 21 December and sometimes 22 December in the Gregorian calendar, because we consider the daily rotation of the Earth to be more important than the exact
moment that the axis of the Earth's tilt is maximally toward or away from the Sun.

You might also write about:

* How are the dates of holidays or religious observances reckoned in your calendar? Are all of them the same? Why or why not? (For instance, Easter moves every year but Christmas doesn't. Why is this?)
* Are there any particularly interesting features of your chosen culture's traditions, geographical origin, or history that inform the calendar, especially those that connect to the stars?
* What are the historical ancestors of your calendar (for instance, the Gregorian calendar draws inspiration from the Julian calendar)?
* How has this calendar adapted to the modern world?

### How will this be graded?

We will grade you out of ten points. The grading will be done mostly by the TA's, and perhaps partly by me (Dr. Freeman).

If you write an exemplary essay here, especially one that teaches us something we didn't know and couldn't have Googled quickly, you may earn up to **double credit**, for a 20/10, or in truly exemplary cases even more. (Dr. Freeman will read most of these.) Longer papers will get no higher of a grade
unless they use their extra words to actually say something interesting. There are 600 of you and grading is going to take a while, so if you only have one page of stuff to say, say it, say it well and succinctly, and be proud.

We will grade you based on:

* astronomical insight and factual correctness
* clarity of writing, including correct use of astronomical terminology (solar and sidereal measures, solstices and equinoxes, and the like.) Note that we will not nitpick spelling or minor grammar issues, and will be particularly lenient to students who have not lived for long in an English-speaking country. I'm more interested in whether your ideas fit together to tell a coherent story.
* ambition and creativity. A very ambitious project to figure out what the weird planet in *Game of Thrones* is doing will be graded more positively than an equally-well-written but straightforward paper discussing the way that the Hebrew calendar works. (Both papers might earn a 10/10, but the second might not 
earn a 20/10.)
* **We are not looking for perfection; we are looking for insight**. I am aware that many of you speak English as a second language. Don't worry about your English skills; I want to know what you think.

### What do we expect?

* We expect you to write an articulate essay consisting of both your own thoughts and (possibly) research that you do at the library or on the internet. 
* We expect you to show clearly which text is original to you, which reflects ideas which you found elsewhere but have digested and expressed in your own words, and which text is a direct quote from someone else's words. **In short, you need to cite your sources, in any clear format you are familiar with**. 
You do not need lots of sources (or, if you are writing about a calendar you already know, any), but any references you use you should tell me about.
This should include at a minimum URL's and page titles for online sources, and book titles, authors, and publication years for books. Note that extensive use of direct quotes is discouraged. A direct quote should only be used when the original author said it better than you possibly could, and if that is 
often the case, then this makes us question your writing skill!
* We expect you to write your paper yourself. Remember my standard for academic integrity: "academic dishonesty consists of substituting someone else's understanding for your own." Talk to other people (and cite them). Look stuff up online! Talk to your friends and get them to read your paper for you!
But, ultimately, you must understand everything you write, and have composed the words yourself.

### When is this due?

Please either give your papers to your lab TA's or place them in their mailboxes, before **5PM Monday, October 1**. Please print your name, lab section number, and TA's name on your paper. The mailboxes are located in front of the Main Office, Physics Building 201. You must also submit an electronic copy by email to suast101projects@gmail.com.
Please put your TA's name and "Calendar paper" in the subject line of your email.

### A word on Wikipedia

Wikipedia articles are often more scholarly, better-written, and more in-depth than anything else on the internet. It is an amazing resource, and the crowdsourcing of the editing has resulted in some very good stuff. However, there are some things on Wikipedia that are not so good, and it is up to **you** to 
tell the difference. This means, ideally, that you go down to Wikipedia's references and follow them to see if *they* are scholarly and well-written, and agree with what the article says. Do not write a paper that is simply a summary of a Wikipedia article. Instead, follow the sources, ask if the information
you are reading is coherent and makes sense and is scholarly, and then (ideally) site Wikipedia's source on the other end in addition to the Wikipedia article. I do not discourage you from using Wikipedia for background information, but remember what it is (a synthesis of other people's ideas, written as an
encyclopedia) and what it is not (the authoritative writing of experts.)

### Modifications for particular calendars

* **The ancient Egyptian calendar**: We think that the new year in the Egyptian calendar was related to the "heliacal rising" of the star Sirius. What does that mean? Is the Egyptian year the exact same length as the modern year? Consider carefully
the effect of the "precession of the equinoxes", the fact that the tilt direction of the Earth's rotation changes slowly over thousands of years.

* **The Jewish calendar or the Chinese calendar**: Both of these calendars are very similar, and are based on something called the "Metonic cycle" in the Western world. They are called *lunisolar calendars* because they try to accurately depict
both the season and the phase of the moon in their timekeeping. If you write about either of these, your paper should discuss questions like:
  * An "intercalary month" is an extra month that is added to the year sometimes. Why do they use intercalary months, when the Western (Gregorian) calendar does not? 
  * How do you determine whether to add an intercalary month to any given year?
  * The Metonic cycle is nineteen years long, after which the pattern of intercalary months repeats. Why is this? Why nineteen?
  * Is the Metonic cycle "perfect", or must a calendar based on it be modified over long periods of time to "keep in sync" with both the cycles of the Sun and the Moon?
  * What are the similarities between the intercalary months used in these calendars and the "leap day" added to every fourth year (or thereabouts) in the Western calendar? What are the differences?

* **The Islamic calendar**: Compare the Islamic calendar to the Jewish calendar. The Jewish calendar uses intercalation, but the Islamic calendar does not. What are the consequences of this? As inspiration, compare the (Gregorian) dates of
Rosh Hashanah and Eid al-Fitr over the last decade. Relate the pattern you see to the fact that the Jewish year sometimes has an intercalary month, but the Islamic year does not. (You can find these 
tabulated online -- see <https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/eid-al-fitr#obs> for Eid al-Fitr and <https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/rosh-hashana#obs> for Rosh Hashanah.

* **Lord of the Rings**: What are these funny *Yule* and *Lithe* things? Why are they there, what function do they serve in the Hobbits' calendar (which is otherwise pretty normal), and why do they have those names? Why is Lithe sometimes extended? Tolkien wanted to write "a mythology for the British people", blending both their Christian and pagan heritage. If the Hobbits are the Britons of Middle-Earth, does this fit?
Additionally, if you are familiar with these elements from the setting, you might address in addition or instead: how do you expect the Star of E&auml;rendil to move in the night sky? Do you expect the Undying Lands (Tol Eress&euml;a and Valinor) to experience days, nights, and seasons in the same
way as the rest of Middle-Earth? (If you've not read the *Silmarillion*, this might not make sense. Your professor is a Tolkien fan, and I know many of you probably are too!)

* **Game of Thrones**: In Game of Thrones, the seasons are quite extreme, last for a long time, and don't have regular cycles. Assuming that the seasons in this world are caused by the same things as they are caused in ours (changes in the amount of sunlight reaching the ground), consider what sorts of physical mechanisms might cause this. (You can propose anything you want: irregular orbits for the planet that Westeros resides on, variations of the axial tilt, etc.) Explain what other consequences this would have for Westeros: what else would a Westerosian astronomer see as a consequence? Would Westeros experience solstices and equinoxes? Would it have tropics and polar regions? Would it be summer on half of the planet, and winter on the other half? Discuss how your proposal fits with the elements in the story. (For instance, if it is summer elsewhere while it is winter in Winterfell, one might imagine shipping food back and forth.) However, you need to describe those elements; not all of your TA's are current with the show or books (and I'm in the middle of Feast for Crows myself, but I'm not spoiler-adverse. You may hear "The Rains of Castamere" later in this class, actually!)

* **The Gregorian Calendar**: Our own calendar is familiar to us, but for high-precision timekeeping it has to be modified. What is a "leap second", and why do we need them? How should we adjust timekeeping if the Earth's rotation speeds up or slows down? What are some predictable things and unpredictable
things that cause this, and how should we adjust timekeeping to deal with it? What about people who need to measure time to one-second precision (the Internet). What about people who need time measurements to one-thousandth of a second (scientists). What about things that need timing precision that's even
smaller than that (GPS satellites)? You may either discuss what people currently do, or make your own proposal for accommodating the needs of people who need to keep time in different ways across the Earth's surface. Comment on the philosophical implications on our ideas of time itself. 
A good place to start reading is
<a href="http://earthsky.org/human-world/leap-second-june-30-december-31-why-need-controversy">this</a> article.

* **Any culture, real or fictional, that emphasizes solstice celebrations (many forms of paganism, for instance)**: Some cultures, historical and fictional, hold celebrations with particular symbolic significance on the Longest Day or Shortest Night (summer solstice), or Longest Night or Shortest Day (winter solstice). 
Suppose that the calendar says that the "date of the Winter Solstice is December 21". Speaking extremely precisely, is the solstice a particular *day*, or something more narrow than that? Suppose your tradition celebrates the Longest Night rather than the Shortest Day, and believes that getting the exact
Longest Night right, even if it is longer just by a few seconds, is important. Should you celebrate on the night spanning the 20th-21st, or the 21st-22nd? What astronomical phenomenon (having to do with the placement and orientation of the Earth and the Sun) is important, and how do you know which night will truly be the 
Longest? If you choose to write about the neopagan Wheel of the Year, then this may occupy a large portion of your paper, even though many Neopagans don't emphasize getting the exact date right for their observances. This is okay, as it's an interesting problem.
*(This question was inspired by a conversation I had with several friends years ago, some of whom recognize the Longest Night on its astronomically-correct date, on a year when the date of the Longest Night differed between regions of the USA.)*
