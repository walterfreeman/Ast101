For Project 3, we won't be doing peer evaluations. (Those will return on Project 4.)

This project is somewhat more involved, and will likely take you several hours. 

If you are comfortable using Google Docs, this will be easiest for you. Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iyLBFfXfyOt31GisChHtM8E-0opAjtoPnChdlVJ-zj4/">Google Docs version</a>; make sure you click "Make a Copy" and share that copy with your group.

You can also download a <a href="project3.docx">Microsoft Word version</a>. Please let me know if you have compatibility problems with it.
