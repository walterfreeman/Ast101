## Questions and Answers

* I would like to know more about the moon’s rotation that we learned briefly about today
  * *We're doing this tomorrow -- stand by!*
* Why are we closer to the sun during winter?
  * *This is an accident having to do with the formation of Earth and the Solar System. Planets' orbits can be nearly circular or extremely elongated, but there are some dynamics over many millions of years that favor more circular orbits. So Earth's orbit is very nearly, but not quite, circular. There is no relation at all between the alignment of the "near" and "far" points in Earth's orbit (called "perihelion" and "aphelion") and the points in Earth's orbit where our axis is tilted most toward/away from the Sun (the solstices). As we'll see tomorrow, the Earth's axis of rotation precesses every 26,000 years, so the 
point in our orbit corresponding to the solstices changes over thousands of years. So in 13,000 years we will be closest to the Sun during our summer (and Australia's winter). Great question!*
* Would we able to move to another planet in 100 years from now?
  * *Visit, almost certainly. We have the technology to send people to Mars now; we just need to do it. But living on another world -- as a permanent settlement -- would be much harder. But a hundred years
is a long time: a hundred years ago, the fancy new inventions were things like radio, commercial aviation, the tank, and X-ray images. A hundred years before that, Beethoven was going deaf and composing the Ninth Symphony. Where will we be in a hundred years? That is our future to decide for ourselves, and our story to write. Humanity has achieved some amazing things in the past; what will we do next?*
* What percentage of the overall grade are homework quizzes worth?
  * *We will have around 7 of them (maybe 8); they are 30 points each. The total points in the semester will be around 900. So about 20-25% of your grade, very roughly. We intend to give you multiple chances
to retake them and demonstrate your knowledge if you didn't know what you were doing the first time.*
* Is there someone else I should email besides you (perhaps a TA) that could get back to me quicker with questions I may have?
  * *The highest priority in my inbox is questions about astronomy (science), so you can expect a fast response from me if you email me about homework. If you have questions about logistics, you may get 
a faster response writing your lab TA. Sometimes I get overwhelmed by email and can't get to non-science questions fast enough. Sorry!*
* Can we look at the new black hole photos at some point?
  * **YES!** *We have an entire day devoted to telescopes of different kinds, and we're using those as an example of an amazing feat of telescope engineering!*
* Format of the tests?
* I'm sure it will be covered when the time comes, but I was wondering about how the exams will work. 
  * *For Exam 1, 15-ish multiple choice questions plus something from each homework quiz plus something similar on the Moon. So 15-ish multiple choice plus 4 free response.*
* You mentioned make-up quizzes for the first homework quiz. I didn't do so good, so I was hoping I could get redo it. Where do I do that? Please email me back how to do so, you or one of the TAs or whomever. It would be much appreciated. Thanks!
* I am a little confused about how retakes for the hw quiz will go.
* When will we be allowed to take quiz retakes?
* Are we able to retake the homework quizzes and get a better grade?
  * *We are hoping to let folks who come to office hours make these up as they wish, but we may not have capacity to do this. What I am probably going to do is to allow people a chance to do this on Monday
afternoons, since those are times when I am going to be around the department. I will probably run a sign-up via Google Forms to ensure that I don't have too many people showing up for me to handle -- 
there is only one of me and a lot of you. You will also have a chance during a scheduled "make-up" time for this later in the semester.*
* What's your favourite movie about something to do with space (i.e, The Martian, Interstellar, etc)?
  * Contact*, the adaptation of the wonderful book by Carl Sagan.*
* How do I tell time based on where the stick figure is on Earth?
  * *Under the Sun = noon, opposite the Sun = midnight. Since the Earth rotates CCW as seen from above the North Pole, if you are rotating away from the Sun = evening, rotating toward the Sun = morning.*
* INTERSTELLAR... explain it
  * *When you are in regions of extremely strong gravity, like near the event horizon of a black hole, other people perceive time to run slowly for you. This is a consequence of general relativity, which
explains gravity as a bending of spacetime: gravity curves the paths that objects move through space in, but also curves their path through time.*
* Really interested in auroras and how they work. 
  * *Great one! Earth is bombarded by charged particles coming from the Sun: the solar wind. Earth's magnetic field channels those toward the North and South magnetic poles, where they strike oxygen and nitrogen atoms in our atmosphere and excite the electrons in them; as we will learn later in the semester, this causes them to emit light of very particular colors in the same way that our fluorescent lights do.*
* Can you give us examples and answers of each assignment? Thank you.
  * *For examples -- you have the homework and exercises themselves. If you have questions about the answers, you can ask in class or watch the solution videos we post.*
* Favorite Star Wars movie?
  * Empire *is great. Phantom Menace was generally bad (screw you, Jar Jar), but Duel of the Fates is a great tune and I've gotten to sing it with the Syracuse symphony orchestra, which was awesome. I enjoyed Rogue One quite a lot, too. Still want them to make a film version of the Timothy Zahn books -- can we have Mara Jade and Thrawn on screen, please?*
* Where does all the matter in the universe come from?
  * *"Why is there something rather than nothing" is a really hard question -- why should anything exist at all? This is beyond the scope of physics. But a question physics can address is "why is there more
matter than antimatter?" If there were the same amount of matter and antimatter, they would have annihilated one another completely. Now, we have no way to produce matter and antimatter separately. But clearly
the Big Bang managed it. There are some ideas, and the Large Hadron Collider was hoping to test some of those ideas, but we didn't find anything conclusive. So people are still working on it -- we don't know!*
* How did the first person realize the earth is rotating around the sun, not the sun rotating around the earth?
  * *This is Thursday's class. :) The short version is that it gave a much simpler explanation of the retrograde motion of the planets.*
* What are your thoughts on the wormholes theory?
  * *It isn't clear if there is a stable solution to Einstein's equations that amounts to a wormhole without proposing something exotic like matter with negative mass, but massive amounts of energy would be
required to stabilize one regardless. They aren't going to provide a feasible form of travel in anything but the furthest future, if at all.*
* [What is] the difference between the mayans and romans using the stars to predict time, etc.
  * *Most cultures saw the same things in the sky. The difference is what cycles in the sky they saw as more important and "set their watches by" -- this is at the intersection of science, culture, mythology, and geography.*
* Is studying astronomy not depressing? Like we’re so small!
  * *We are! But we can understand so much. This is actually how we will end our class -- the very last words in AST101 address this question. We are small and our lives are brief, but we've built a telescope that can see the echoes of the Big Bang and the first galaxies, and see that they are made of the same sorts of atoms as our bodies are. And that's pretty damn amazing for a bunch of hairless apes stuck on a little rock around the Sun. I plan on sharing a former student's inspiring answer to this question at the end!*
* Are there any videos on astronomy that are interesting and informative？
  * *Many, many, many. The classic set is the TV program "Cosmos", originally by Carl Sagan, then remade in the modern era by his protege Neil deGrasse Tyson.*
* Why do people believe there are traits and characteristics due to when you were born and what stars are in the sky? And who decided those traits?
  * *People have invented lots of traditions and mythologies over the years. Why do people believe that knocking on wood repels bad luck? A possible answer is in the notion of "memes" -- see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme#Dawkins> for a discussion. I don't know why they picked the things they did!*
* What sound does a black hole make? 
  * *One black hole doesn't make a sound. Two colliding goes "bloorp" and wins the Nobel Prize -- see <https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/video/ligo20160211v2>.*
* Why do people say "look it's the milky way" when they look at the sky and see more dense clusters of stars, but aren't we pretty much inside the milky way galaxy so wouldn't the whole entire sky technically be the milky way? 
  * *Aha! Great question. We're actually toward the outside of the Milky Way, so there are way more stars on one side of us (vaguely in the direction of Sagittarius) than the other.*
* I’m interested in the astronomer photography club bc I saw the table at the club fair!
  * *We're working on that. :) I'll ask this week about who'd be interested in a trip!*
* Do we have to work in groups for the lab?
  * *Yep! Science is a collaborative thing: it is a conversation between people.*
* Can we be allowed to bring mini inflatable globes to be brought to our quizzes and exams?
  * *Yes! I have some extras if you want one. :)*
* What’s the worst space movie you’ve ever watched?
  * *Anything with Jar Jar Binks.*
* What's the point of going to the moon? Wouldn't going there the first time have been enough since it's not really habitable to sustain life, but they sent several missions there? 
  * *We'll study this in late November. :) The point, originally, was for the USA and USSR to compete in demonstrating their mastery of rocketry, since a moon rocket involves similar technology to a nuclear-armed ICBM. But humans find exploration more compelling than war, and it quickly became about doing something awesome rather than killing one another.*
* And can we learn more about the international space station?
  * *We can talk about it when we get to our spaceflight section -- remind me!*
* Do you think space travel should be regarded higher in society?
  * *I don't deign to dictate to society what avenues of human achievement we should prioritize. Should we go to Mars or address climate change? Go to the Moon or study genetic engineering? Launch satellites or make the Avengers movies? I have my own ideas, but I don't claim they are better than other people's!*
* Why/How is the Earth tilted?
  * *Our fast rotation on a tilted axis may be left over from a collision with other stuff early in the Solar System's history. We know such a collision happened since it formed the Moon.*
* Is it true the stars we see aren’t really there anymore?
  * *Yes, sort of! They are delayed by the light travel time, so we are seeing Vega where it was 25 years ago and Polaris where it was 200 years ago. They don't move far in this time, though. But our telescopes can see stars ten billion light years away, and many of those stars will have reached the end of their lives since then. (Most are still around!)*
* Why people make it look as Astronomy is hard, when in reality it just requires you to be open minded and intrigued? 
  * *Because being open-minded is hard, and thinking clearly about simple things IS hard. Physics is simple; that does not make it easy. Anyone can do physics, but it takes practice and mental discipline -- like playing a musical instrument.*
* I know you said you had a section of this class after mine. Am I able to take quizzes in the 2nd section if I don't make it to the 1st for some reason?
  * *Sure!*
* Are we going to have review sessions before our exams?
  * *I will look into having extended office hours next Monday for this.*
* I'm confused about HW 2 and when you can see the astrological signs. For the question in the homework for how long until a sign was able to be seen the answer was 2 months, but after one month the sign in question wasn't directly behind the sun. Why wouldn't they be able to see that sign then?
  * *They could after one month -- after one month had passed, that constellation wouldn't be exactly lined up with the sun, so there'd be a brief time after sunset or before sunset when you could get a glimpse of it -- maybe. Generally, twilight / pre-dawn glow washes out the constellations near the Sun, though.*
* Yes, I choose this class is due to a video game called "Stellaris" had inspired my interest on astronomy, where inside the game, players can control their civilizations' convey or other units to travel between solar system through a fixed path called 'hyperlane'. I am curious is that a really scientific based or just fiction?
  * *I've played Stellaris! Hyperlanes are fictional; while it's a remote possibility that people could create stable distortions in spacetime like this in the very far future with unimaginably advanced technology, it's well within the realm of science fiction for the forseeable future.*
* Do we just reach out to you if your office hours don’t work?
  * *Sure, or come find me another time! Or you can go to the Physics Clinic some other time.*
* How do you know what zodiac constellations you can see at night?
  * *At a certain time of year, when Earth is in a particular place, draw a stick figure on whatever part of Earth you are thinking about -- night is the half pointed away from the Sun. Then you can
tell what is above your horizon.*
* Is there tutoring for your class?
  * *Yep! At my office hours, or at the Physics Clinic any other time.*
* How much do we know about solar systems in other galaxies?
  * *Nothing at all -- other than that they probably are very similar to ours. We are only able to see planets around other stars close to us; we don't have the ability to discern something as small as a planet that far away.*
* I'm enjoying the course a lot, although I wish there was more math and physics like general relativity.  
  * *We have more math-y astrophysics classes! Take PHY317 next spring and PHY312 next fall, and come talk to me about becoming a physics major if you like this stuff!*
* Is this class going to get easier? I really don't have time to worry about a science class this year. 
  * *It is, somewhat. Visualizing things in three dimensions, while it's the first thing people did in the sky, is also difficult for people not accustomed to thinking in three dimensions. But there will be
work that requires a time investment: this is a four-credit lab class, after all. Anyone who devotes the time to this class should pass, but you will need to put in some time.*
* "I enjoy taking it in person!"
  * *I've missed seeing students in person. I taught this class in front of a green-screen and studio lights to 750 people on Twitch in fall 2020. That sucked and was lonely. Now I get to see everyone again!*
