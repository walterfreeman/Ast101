In the light of the current vandalism on campus, I would like to first off address to all of you who are international students. I am honored and I am humbled that so many of you from around the world have traveled so far to 
come study in my little old astronomy class here at Syracuse. 
It's the greatest compliment that anyone could give our class and our university. 

It doesn't matter what country is on your passport; this is your class and this is your campus, as much as they are anyone's. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is wrong. You are entitled to a happy, safe,
healthy education here, and anyone who tries to take this from you with insults or threats is not welcome. If there is anything I can do to help any of you -- whether that's helping to protect your safety, or just to listen to your experiences -- 
please let me know, and I will do whatever I can to support you. 

You have as much right as anyone to shape this campus, and you are honored guests in this country. 

<br>

At a time when the world was concerned about nuclear annihilation and seemed divided in two, we sent a little robot into space.

So many of our brightest minds were spending their genius on producing plutonium to make nuclear weapons, but this little craft used the energy stored in plutonium instead to generate warmth and electricity, 
keeping its instruments and radios running in the cold void. And some of the more hopeful among us, scientists who spent as much time imagining what a better world might look like as they spent calculating the details of ours, argued that
before Voyager's power dwindled to the point where it no longer could, we should take one last picture of Earth. So they turned that little robot around, and 

Here it is -- all of us, made of the same atoms as each other and as the stars, all on this little blue pixel right here. This is but one in a long line of moments when we've looked to the stars and told stories about them that bring us together and that inspire a shared sense of community. 

<p>

But throughout our history on this little world people have drummed up fear of The Other for selfish reasons. 
Fear of people who look different, who believe in different gods, who love differently, who speak different languages, or who call different places home is being used to drum up hatred and exclusion. Really? We're going to deny someone their fundamental dignity because their ancestors came from a different spot on that pixel, or because they have a bit more melanin in their skin?

<p>

It's ridiculous. 

And it's also cowardly. When I look at students like you all and listen to your stories I see an army of diverse folks poised to bend the arc of the future toward a better world for the benefit of humanity, one that will have a place for *all* of us:
children of a supernova and sisters of the Sun, people who are unafraid to look to the future and choose what it will hold. 

But, instead of joining the fight for a better world, these cowards see you all and are terrified of the world that you will build, 
since it will have a place for everyone, not only folks who are exactly like them.

<p>

They are, in short, afraid. 

<p>

I'm just a scientist. I've chosen to devote my career to teaching people what's in the Universe and how it works, and hoping that the things of astronomy and physics, in their elegance and beauty, will inspire some of you as they've inspired me. 

But science is not omnipotent. All science can do is to describe what things are in the world and how they work; when confronted with
questions of ethics and society it must step aside humbly and yield to others, acting in their service. 

At the beginning of this class I told you that this class belonged to all of you, and especially to the non-science majors. 
For the last three years you're the ones whose skills have seemed so much more valuable than my own. If after today's class one of you political science majors is able to argue a little more compellingly that climate change is not a hoax but a very real problem that warrants urgent attention, then 
I'm a happy fellow. 

If any of you journalism majors have taken just a bit of the scientific philosophy of skepticism and pluralism to heart, and doggedly pursue an investigative story with integrity rather than accepting the dictates of the powerful, then I couldn't care less whether you remember Kepler's laws. 

<p>

If one of you television/radio/film or creative writing majors -- the storytellers and the dreamers among the class -- is inspired by anything in this class to tell a tale about the pursuit of a better life beyond the confines of Earth, then you've made my work worth it. Your questions about other worlds that might be are, if anything, more crucial now than folks like myself who study mostly only this world that we have. 

<p>

This Thursday, we'll tell the tale of how humans went from looking at the birds with envy to walking on the Moon and reaching for the stars. The greatest gift that science has given us is the promise that we can understand our world, and that 
by combining that understanding with hard work, ethical action, and compassion for others, we can shape our own destiny. If any of you take any inspiration from this story and more forcefully assume your birthright as stewards of our society and our future,
and confront the unacceptable things in our world and say "This cannot stand!", then you understand the central message of this course.

<p>

In this era of animosity I can't do much directly. My abilities, to understand the physical world and to help others understand it, are not able to banish the present idiocy that afflicts us. 

But I am not just a scientist and not just your teacher. I am also your colleague and your coworker, and I can do *something*. If you need support -- for whatever reason, in whatever way -- let me know. If you just need to talk, come find me.

<p>

And I want you all to know that no matter what grades you make and no matter what you look like -- no matter what god or gods you do or don't believe in, how you dress, what language you speak, what country you're from, how many of Kepler's laws you remember, what gender you are and how you express it, or the person or people you love -- you are welcome in my class. You're welcome at our university and 
in this country. You're equal in dignity to each and every other person in this room. You're free to express your ideas, here and elsewhere, in any peaceful way that affords others this same liberty. And if 
<b>anybody</b> on this campus tries to deny you this welcome, this dignity, or these rights, let me know. Let the rest of your faculty know. And we'll stand with you and work alongside you to make things right.
