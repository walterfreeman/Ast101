This page has group information listed for everyone in our class. Make sure you find your own listing. (Unless you are Andrew Dinnhaupt, the first listing isn't yours!)

This page has been updated with all of the changes we have made. We are still working through your requests. You should work with the groups listed here unless you get a confirmation of a change.

If there is something wrong with your group assignment, please email <suastronomy101@gmail.com> and we will take a look. If the issue involves an issue with your partners not doing what they should,
then also cc: <fchahili@syr.edu>.

Students are listed in alphabetical order by email address. It will be easiest if you search for your own name. You may have to search a couple of times, since your name will
appear in the information for other students who are in your group or who will be sending you their work for evaluation.

Again, unless you are Andrew Dinnhaupt, the first listing is not yours.
