## Lab 5

<a href="labs/solar_system_models.pdf">Lab 5 handout</a>

**Background information:**

This lab covers ideas (the heliocentric explanation of retrograde motion of the planets) that we have discussed in class. <br>


You should be familiar with the principle. However, the nuts and bolts of
this will involve some new terminology and some thought. You will want to read the background material
carefully, and ask your TA and groupmates questions if there's something you don't understand.
