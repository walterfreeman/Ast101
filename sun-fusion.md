# The Sun
We've explained the solar spectrum now: 

* the hot innards of the Sun emit blackbody radiation because of their temperature
* the cooler gases in the Sun's atmosphere absorb those wavelengths corresponding to their energy-level transitions, giving rise to the missing wavelengths (dark lines) in the spectrum

But why is the Sun so hot? What's the source of the Sun's energy in the first place?

### Nuclear fusion

The answer is **nuclear fusion** -- a nuclear reaction involving building larger nuclei out of smaller ones.

The Sun is mostly made of hydrogen. The inside of the Sun is so hot, and under such terrific pressure, that all of the electrons are torn off of their atoms; for this discussion, we're going to be thinking only about the nuclei of these atoms. Most hydrogen nuclei are just single protons.

As you know, protons are positively charged. Since like charges repel, if two protons get near each other, they will violently repel each other. It takes a tremendous amount of heat and pressure to overcome this. However, this amount of heat and pressure is found in the heart of the Sun, where the temperature reaches 15 million Kelvin (or Celsius). 

So, what happens if you smash together two protons hard enough? Well, if you can overcome the electric repulsion and bring them very close together, then there is an *attractive* nuclear force that will then hold them together. In the process, one of them changes to a neutron (absorbing an electron in the process). This gives us a new kind of atomic nucleus, one made out of a neutron and a proton stuck together. (It's called "deuterium" -- chemically, it is an isotope of hydrogen, but for nuclear purposes we can think of deuterium as a separate sort of atomic nucleus.)

Because of the tremendous attractive force between the two particles, this releases a great deal of energy. 

In symbols, we might write:

$$(P) + (P) + (e) \rightarrow (NP) $$

Hitting it with another proton gives us two protons and one neutron stuck together:
 
$$(NP) + (P) \rightarrow (NPP)$$

This sort of nucleus with a neutron and two protons is called "helium-3" -- it's got two protons, making it helium, and three total particles.

Finally, another reaction happens if we smash two of these together:

$$(NPP) + (NPP) \rightarrow (NNPP) + (P) + (P)$$

(NNPP), the nucleus with two neutrons and two protons, is just ordinary helium.

The details of these processes aren't as important as the end result: we smashed together four protons -- hydrogen nuclei -- and built a helium nucleus, made out of two neutrons and two protons. This process releases a fantastic amount of energy -- millions of electron-volts per atom involved.

This process, fusing together light nuclei to make heavy ones and releasing energy in the process, is called nuclear fusion. The current source of the Sun's energy is hydrogen-into-helium fusion, as it is for most stars in the Universe.

### The fate of the Sun

The ultimate evolution and fate of stars is more properly a topic for AST 104. However, I'll say a few words about it here. 

As this reaction progresses, all this helium being produced will build up in the Sun's core. It is possible to fuse helium into oxygen, and likewise build heavier and heavier elements out of that, all the way up to iron on the periodic table. However, these later reactions produce much less energy than the hydrogen-to-helium one shown above, and they require much higher temperatures and pressures to sustain. As a star depletes its "easy-burn" hydrogen fuel in the core, it undergoes a violent convulsion as the heat source at the center is shut off. 

The outer layers of hydrogen falling onto the helium core will eventually heat up so much under their own gravity that *they* will, in turn, start to fuse. This reignites the star, causing the outer layers and the star's atmosphere to puff up to enormous size; it becomes a *red giant*. Our Sun will do this in another seven billion years or so, becoming so large that its outer layers swallow up the Earth.

This is our planet's fate; will we be extinct or have found another home by then?

Eventually, the helium falling onto the core will heat it to such a high temperature that it will start fusing into carbon and oxygen, all at once. But this helium fuel will not last long; as it begins to run out, the Sun will go through a series of violent convulsions, expelling most of its outer material -- mostly unfused hydrogen and helium -- to make a nebula. The Sun doesn't have enough mass to generate enough pressure to fuse carbon and oxygen, so this is where its tale ends. Left behind will be the naked core of the Sun, made of carbon and oxygen -- a *white dwarf*. No more nuclear fusion happens: it will glow only because of its residual heat, a memory of the billions of years of nuclear fusion. Over tens and hundreds of billions of years, this white dwarf will slowly cool and grow dim.

### Summary

The things you need to make sure you know for the exam are:

* Nuclear fusion is the combining of light nuclei, like hydrogen, to make heavier ones, like helium
* This process releases enormous amounts of energy, but can only happen at high temperatures and pressures
* The energy source of most stars, including our Sun, is hydrogen-to-helium nuclear fusion
* Once the Sun runs out of hydrogen in its core, it will become a red giant, swallowing the Earth
* Eventually it will ignite the helium that it has been producing all this time; the helium will not fuel it for more than a few hundred million years, and soon it will convulse violently, eject its outer layers, and leave behind a white dwarf -- a slowly-cooling remnant of the nuclear powerhouse it once was.
