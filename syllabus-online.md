### Who's who

There are a lot of people teaching this class; who are they?

#### The professor
Walter is in charge of giving the lectures, writing materials, helping students in any way I can (with my class or anything else!), supervising grading, and leading the course as a whole.

If you want to talk to me, come to office hours (held outdoors or virtually) or ask me a question
on the class Piazza forum. You can also email me about private issues at <wafreema@syr.edu>; however, if you email me a question 
that other students might be interested in, I will ask you to post it instead to Piazza so other people can
benefit from the answer.

Contact Walter if:

* You have a question about astronomy (or anything else!)
* You have a suggestion that will improve your experience in the course as a whole or the lecture portion specifically
* Something is badly wrong in your lab that your TA can’t fix, or that you don’t feel comfortable discussing with them
* You will miss a large amount of work
* You need high-level assistance with anything

#### The TA's
The lab teaching assistants are PhD students in physics who work as junior instructors as part of their training. 
They are in charge of leading labs and helping grade your work. You can contact them by email or 
through Piazza, or by simply talking to them during lab.

Contact the TA’s if:
* You have a question about astronomy
* You have a suggestion that will improve their lab, or that you want them to pass on to me
* Something is wrong with your grade
* You will miss a lab
* The people in your lab group are not working together effectively

They are:

Faraz Chahili, <fchahili@syr.edu>, lead TA
Suman Kundu, <skundu@syr.edu>, lead TA
Mario Olivares, <maolivar@syr.edu>, lead TA
Jeff Frelier, <jpfrelie@syr.edu>
Penelope Taylor, <ptaylo01@syr.edu>
Clayton Larson, <cllarson@syr.edu>
Vincent Musso, <vjmusso@syr.edu>
Hang Pham, <hpham02@syr.edu>
Yuezhe Yao, <yyao102@syr.edu>
Vidyesh Anisetti, <vvaniset@syr.edu>



#### The coaches
The coaches are undergraduate students like yourself who took this class in the past and who will be helping you learn during lecture and lab. 

You can contact them by talking to them during class or lab, or when they are helping out online at other times; they will also be answering questions on Piazza and other platforms.

Some of the coaches will be able to help you in person during your lab in places that are convenient for your group (maybe even in your dorm!) if they know where you are meeting.

Talk to the undergraduate coaches if:
* You have a question about astronomy, the labs, or your homework
* You want advice on studying (they were in your shoes pretty recently and can give the best advice of any of us!)

#### A note on email

We will receive prodigious amounts of email this semester and will sometimes get behind on answering mail. Please help us out! There are two things you can do:

1. If you have a question that might apply to other students, please post it to Piazza instead of sending it as an email. We can then answer it there, and other people will benefit.

2. When you email us, please include a meaningful subject line in your message telling us what it is about; don’t write “Astronomy 101”, since almost all of the mail I get is about Astronomy 101, and that doesn’t help! Also don't use a 
subject line of "Lab" -- tell me what your issue is with your lab!

We will try to answer all messages within two days. If you don’t get a reply after three days, but your message needs a reply, please just send us your message again to remind us. (We get a lot of mail!)

### Course philosophy 

#### 1. Our birthright: a beautiful Universe

Our class, more than anything else, is a story: the story of how we humans came to understand 
our place in the Universe, how that Universe works, and how we have used and can continue 
to use that knowledge to change our lives and our world for the better. Astronomy was the first
of the sciences, and the heavens were the playground where the scientific method developed.
In our class we will learn how the sky works and how we know about it, but we will also explore 
what it means for humanity: how over the last few thousand years we have gone from the Stone Age to
walking on another world and exploring the furthest reaches of the Universe. 

It is the story of how our species has grown up and discovered that the Universe
 holds more promise for us and is more beautiful than we ever could have imagined.
And so we will study that beauty, too: how the heavens have inspired generations of 
poets, artists, dreamers, and authors.

<!-- Most people’s interest in astronomy begins as children, when they look up at the night sky and say “Wow, that’s gorgeous; I want to know more about that!” Or, perhaps, they watch *Star Trek* or *Battlestar Galactica* and want to know more about the universe outside our world that inspired the storytellers. The ancients’ interest in astronomy began with more pragmatic goals in mind: the night sky can be used to navigate. We’ve been to the moon, we’ve sent robots to the planets, and two lonely spacecraft are floating out to the stars, keeping in fading contact with us for the time being using the dwindling power from their plutonium-powered transmitters. Perhaps, someday, we will follow them? Regardless of the reason, astronomy has captured the imagination of humanity like no other science, and we would be amiss in our study of astronomy not to look at the broader influence that the heavens have had on the larger sweep of human imagination and thought.-->

#### 2. Reasoning and synthesis, not memorization

This course is emphatically not a class where you will come to lecture, sit there and listen to a presentation of some facts, and then repeat them back to me on exams. Rather, you will need to think about how we’ve gained the understanding that we have about our universe, and engage in scientific reasoning based on astronomical principles. You are not going to be learning a list of currently-accepted facts; you are going to be practicing skills and learning to see the universe as scientists see it. This will require hard work from you: you're going
to be *doing* and *thinking*, not just passively amassing facts. 

#### 3. Group work


One of the most vibrant aspects of university life is the intellectual community you form with your peers. In normal circumstances this sort of community forms naturally, as you become friends and colleagues with the people around you in your classes. This semester, this sort of community will be even more important (as you support each other through a difficult time), but harder to maintain (since you will often be online). 

Thus, we will be more deliberate than we usually are in providing a structure for this community to you. We will assign you to groups and expect you to work together with the folks in your group on our class. You should get to know them, exchange contact information, and establish a means of working together that works well for the three of you. 

We expect everyone to contribute in their groups. Part of your grade will be based on your groupmates' evaluation of you. Likewise, the things that your group creates will be read by other groups. Your projects aren't just a way for
you to demonstrate what you know; they're a way for you to create things that other people in our class will
learn from. Their evaluations will be part of your grade, and the grade that they give you will be based not
just on whether your work is correct but whether they could learn from it.

You will be vital supports to each other in both learning our material and during this weird semester as a whole. Our class is full of friendly people; become friends with them! A part of your grade will come from how effectively your group works together, and you will assess that yourselves. 

If there is a problem with how your group is collaborating -- if one person is not making any effort, or if one person is not collaborating well with the others -- then please tell your TA. These sorts of issues will both make the class a lot less enjoyable and interfere with your learning, but they can be fixed. Let us know, and we will fix them.




<!-- #### 2. Astronomy as a liberal art

Most of you won’t become astrophysicists; you will become designers and businessfolk, architects and reporters, doctors and lawyers, and writers and thinkers, and I hope that you will take some of the inspiration, the poetry, the philosophy, the wisdom, and the wonder of astronomy into your chosen disciplines and your lives.

#### 3. This is your class, too

As part of this philosophy, I welcome your input. If there is some aspect of astronomy that inspires or fascinates you, please ask; if you have feedback for me that will help you enjoy the class more, then please let me know.>>

-->

### Public Health

Our highest priority during this semester is the preservation of your health and ours. The University has already sent you the general things we expect students to do to protect public health. In our class:

* We expect you to wear a face covering when indoors or when interacting with others outdoors. If you have a medical reason that you can’t do so, notify your instructor.

* Stay at least six feet from others when possible, indoors and outdoors. If you need to get closer than that to one person for brief periods outdoors, that is okay if you are wearing a mask.

* Don’t share tools or apparatus without cleaning them with sanitizer or alcohol; in particular, don’t share pencils, computers, etc., with your classmates.

These principles apply whenever you are working with your classmates, whether it is during class time or not.

These guidelines may change during the semester to reflect changing conditions and knowledge; we will let you know if this happens.

If you forget your mask, instructors will likely have extras; ask us, and we may have one for you.

If a student is unwilling to do their part to preserve public health, then we will ask them to leave and complete their work online.

#### What to do if you’re not feeling well
One of the most important things you can do is to stay home if you are sick. All of the components of our class can be done remotely, and if you are feeling unwell -- particularly if your symptoms involve nausea, cough, fever, or others common in COVID-19 -- you should connect to our class remotely, and inform us that you are working remotely because you are ill. If you are supposed to meet your group in person to work on homework, tell them that you're feeling sick, and ask to connect remotely; they'll understand.

We often have a culture of trying to “push through” when we’re not feeling well, saying things like “Yeah, I am sick, but I will be okay -- I can still go to class”. While this sort of perseverance in general is a good thing, coming to class when you’re sick puts other people’s health at risk. So, if you have any symptoms at all, stay home.

#### What to do if you’re seriously sick
If you have an illness or injury that interferes with your ability to do work in our class, talk to us! The Center for Disability Resources also helps students with short-term injuries and illnesses -- concussions, broken bones, etc. If you are sick or hurt, we will work with you and with CDR to do whatever we can to accommodate your condition. 

If you are too sick to participate in class, even remotely, don’t worry! We want you to focus on taking care of yourself rather than on physics classes. If you are sick and miss things, we will be flexible with deadlines to allow you to catch up. 

If you miss a large amount of class (two weeks or more), you may be eligible to take an “incomplete grade” in the course.
This is a “grade pending” status that means that you were not able to finish all your work during the semester. Once you finish up your work in the spring, we can go back and give you your final grade.
If you think you might need to use this option, it is important to talk to us as early as possible so we can discuss arrangements. In general, only students who have completed a meaningful amount of classwork with a passing grade are eligible to take an incomplete.

#### What happens if your instructors get sick?
If any of your instructors contract COVID-19, we will do our best to get a substitute instructor for you as soon as possible. If this happens, however, we cannot risk a spreading set of cases in our class. In this case, it is likely that the remainder of our class will transition to being fully online. 

### Inclusion, Equality, and Dignity
Everyone in this class is an equally-valued member of this university and our community. We expect you to treat your classmates as honored colleagues in the collective endeavor we are all involved in: to understand the natural world and use that understanding to improve our society. 

In particular, bias against or denigration of anyone in our class because of their gender or how they express it, their sexual orientation, their religion, their national origin, their race or ethnicity, or a disability they may have will not be tolerated. If you are the target of this sort of bias or if you witness it, please report it directly to me and I will take swift action. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to me, you may report it anonymously to the Physics Department at <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNduLL1hc9fJu5MRaKjajJFnlTDiDio0xvqprn9kCXDpS2Cg/viewform>. If Google Forms is not accessible to you, then you may create an anonymous email address and send your concerns directly to my chair at <jlross@syr.edu>.



### Remote Access and Format

#### Tech platforms

* We will use **Blackboard Collaborate** as our primary way to have class meetings for both lab and lecture. 
You will need to become familiar with it.

* You should use either **Google Docs** or **Office 365/Sharepoint** to work together on documents with your groups. (Your group should choose one or the other.)

* **Piazza** is an online discussion board, designed to let you ask and answer questions easily. You will get
extra credit for providing good answers to your classmates' questions; instructors will also be around to 
answer your questions. It will be the best resource for you to ask for assistance for your homework, for instance.

* You may wish to use your own **Zoom** rooms to collaborate with your groupmates, 
as it is better than Collaborate for small groups. I will hold my online office hours using Zoom as well. FIXME: link

* The teaching staff will use **Slack** as a way for us to collaborate. You are welcome to join the Slack team
and chat with us there. FIXME: invite link

If for some reason you are unable to access one of these tools that you need, please let the teaching staff know as soon as possible so we can make alternate arrangements for you to access everything in our class.


#### Format

The “lecture” component of our class will be held fully online. You will connect using Blackboard Collaborate and participate that way. We hope to have lively discussions in class using the chat tool, so this isn’t something that you will just listen to passively! 

We will have two types of lab sections. Some of them will have a TA present in person; others will be 
exclusively online. 
Regardless of the type of lab you are enrolled in, you are encouraged to meet with your lab group in person
on campus and work with them. 
Of course, if you aren't able to do this, you can always work with them online.

If you are enrolled in one of the in-person sections and are unable to attend in person, you should make 
arrangements to work with your group over the internet, using Blackboard Collaborate.


If you are not able to join us at the regular time, you will also be able to complete your work asynchronously. We will be recording all of the lectures, so you can watch them later. 

For the online portions of our class, you will need a stable internet connection, a computer, and some portable device with a camera. A headset or earbuds will be very helpful.

If you don’t have and can’t easily get these things, contact us; we may be able to help you out. Likewise, if you have an equipment failure during the semester, we will work with you to ensure that you don’t fall behind while waiting on repair or replacement of your equipment. 

If for some reason some component of our online material is not accessible to you (because of a disability, a technological limitation, or anything else), please let us know. Don't just fall behind or miss things without
asking us for help; we will do whatever we can to make our class work for you, but we have to know what you 
need.

#### Recordings

We will be recording the lecture portion of our class so that people not present can follow along. These recordings will include things that students say in chat, since that conversation is an essential part of the class experience. Recordings from our class will generally be available only to other members of our class. In order to accord your classmates the freedom to say what they wish in class without fear of criticism or embarrassment, please do not distribute these recordings.

Lab sections will generally not be recorded.

### Course Material

This course focuses mostly on the astronomy of the solar system, and is divided into four broad sections:

*1.* **What we can see from Earth:** the stars, the moon, and the sun, how the night sky changes, and why it looks the way it does

*2.* **Celestial motion:** why the planets move in the ways that they do, how we know that, and the laws of gravity and orbits

*3.* **The nature of light:** what light is, how it tells us about the Universe, and how it affects the heavens

*4.* **Humans and the Universe:** the past, present, and future of spaceflight, and the possibility of life elsewhere

<a id="objectives"></a>

### Learning Objectives

A more detailed version of the <a href="learning-objectives.html">learning objectives for this class</a> is on a separate page.

In short, after this class, you will be able to...

* describe the characteristics of scientific thought and recognize sound and unsound science
* write articulate criticism of unsound science
* discuss astronomy's connection to the arts and humanities
* predict how things move in the sky based on knowledge of how they move in space
* describe the history of the development of the modern view of the solar system
* use Kepler's laws of motion and Newton's laws of mechanics to analyze and predict the motions of planets
* relate an object's chemical composition and temperature to the spectrum of the light it emits
* describe the basic properties and histories of the planets, and the role of atmospheres in determining their climate
* speak articulately about the mechanisms behind anthropogenic climate change and the evidence for it
* describe the past, present, and possible future of spaceflight

### Course Activities 

#### Readings

We are using a free textbook this semester, but it's actually quite good -- and not excessively long. We won't be going through the book in order; 
instead, we will jump around through topics in an order that makes more sense for our class. 

I encourage you to read the assigned sections on the [calendar](./calendar.html) ahead of time, as that way the presentation of the material in class will serve as reinforcement and enrichment rather than be the first time you see something. 

#### Class Meetings

The large-class meetings will take two different forms, both on Blackboard Collaborate.

Whenever I am mostly talking to the whole class, we will meet in the "course room". During class I will ask some poll questions; it is important that you are there there to answer these, since those responses are both useful for me to assess
how you are doing and give me feedback and will be used to assess your class participation grade. If you are watching the recordings afterward, then I will post those poll questions as a Blackboard "quiz" for you to answer. (Your grade will not
depend on whether you get the right answers.)

#### Written homework and peer evaluation

You will have group homework assignments during the semester that have a twist to them. **The most unique part about the homework in this class is that you are writing for an audience of your peers -- to explain something to them -- rather than
for an audience of your instructors**. Your grade will reflect how well your explanation helps someone else understand *why* things work the way they do, not simply on whether you got the correct answer.

Each time we have homework, your group will work together to prepare an explanation for another group to view. Your explanation may be a document -- but it could also be a video, a series of pictures, etc. 
That group will then look at your work, discuss how much they learned from it, and assess your work. Likewise, you will then get a copy of someone _else's_ work, and will assess it. You will need to decide:

* whether their work is factually correct
* whether their explanation is understandable
* whether you learned something from what they've done

and write for them some feedback.

You will return your assessment to them and to us; we'll review your assessment. Then you will get _two_ grades:

* a grade on your own work, as assessed by your peers. (We'll give you the grade they gave you, if it is reasonable. If it's not, we'll give you whatever you earned.)
* a grade on your assessment of their work. If your assessment is reasonable and thoughtful you will get full credit.

#### Papers

Throughout the semester I will also assign several short writing assignments. These will focus on the connections between astronomy and the broader study of the humanities; astronomy is likely the scientific discipline that has
both exerted the greatest influence on, and been influenced the most by, the broader story of human intellect and philosophy. The topics will be, broadly, as follows:

* First paper: an exploration of the connection between timekeeping and the sky, as embodied in a historical, present, or fictional calendar 
* Second paper: an exploration of the nature of science, and a discussion of what scientific thought is and what it is not
* Third paper: a reflection on the link between science and human progress, and on the theme of this class: "Science lets us write our own better future."
* Final project: Extremely open-ended; a topic you didn't choose from earlier, or a topic or creative fine-art project that you propose yourself, or an elaboration on your third paper.

For the first two of these assignments, you will need to first submit a draft to be evaluated by someone else in the class. They will give you feedback on your work and give you a chance to improve it before your final submission. 

Some of you, at some point in the semester, will probably ask me for extra credit. **This is it**; these papers will be graded out of ten points, but there is no limit on the grade you can achieve. 

#### Labs
<a id="labs"></a>
AST101 satisfies the laboratory course requirement of the liberal arts core and so it has a lab component.
 Many important course activities take place in the laboratories, and so attendance at the lab sections is required. 
There is also a take-home lab that you complete by making observations of the Sun and/or the Moon over a period of several weeks.
Because the labs are a crucial element of the course, no student may receive a final grade for the course more than one letter grade
above their lab average. (That is, if you get a D for the lab, the highest grade you can get for the class is a C.)

There will also be several take-home labs, which are similar in character to homework, assigned during the semester. 

Your lab grade will reflect both your participation while in lab and the quality of the work you submit. 

Labs will be graded on a five point scale:

* 0: Nothing, or nothing relevant (F)
* 1: A minimal attempt or severe errors (F)
* 2: The assignment is partially complete or contains multiple major errors (D)
* 3: The assignment is complete, but contains errors in the solutions (C)
* 4: The assignment is complete, but may contain several minor errors (B)
* 5: The assignment is complete and substantially correct. (A)

Note that the point of the lab portion of the class is to learn by doing; it is not to "get the right answers". 
Your grade is based on your understanding of what is going on *as reflected by* what you turn in; it is not based only on a mechanical evaluation of whether you "wrote down the right answers or not".
In the past we have had
some students who copied lab answers from students in other sections or the internet. This is a serious sort of academic dishonesty that will
result in you failing the course (or worse).

The lab attendance policy is as follows:

* You should attend lab at the time that you registered for. If you aren't able to attend lab at that time, then you must find a different time _with your group_ to meet together and do the lab.
If that is a scheduled lab meeting time, then you can just attend in person or online. If you do this, one of your group members should email the TA of the section you are attending, cc: the rest 
of your group, explaining that you are attending their section instead and why.

Alternatively, you may post on Piazza asking if a coach is available to work with your group at some other time and place. 

* You should come to lab on time. If you show up more than fifteen minutes late for your lab then your other groupmates will likely give you a low grade on their assessment, and your TA may also flag this and assign a penalty.
If you are going to be late, the people to talk to are _your groupmates_, not your TA. Contact _them_ and explain to them why you are late.

* During lab you're expected to do the lab in collaboration with your group, as with everything else in this class.
 

* Once you finish your lab, one person in your group should email a link to the shared document you all worked on to suast101labs@gmail.com, cc: the other group members. This is due within 12 hours of the end of your lab.

* TA's have wide latitude to make decisions, and they may allow for leniency on a case-by-case basis; however, this is the exception, not the rule.

We're very willing to work with and around problems that you may encounter in helping you succeed in our 
class; please let us know if something is going on that requires special accommodations. However, by default, this is the expectation.

### Grading

There are no exams in this class. 
Instead, your grade will come primarily from your papers, homework, and labs. Since there are no exams,
we expect you to take your commitment to your group in your lab work and your homework as seriously as you would take studying for exams.

If you do not submit a first draft of one of your papers on time for someone else to evaluate, then you will only get half credit for the paper. (It will also not be as good as it could have been!) This may be
a rough draft, of course.

| Item                     |            Date        | Points           |
|--------------------------|:----------------------:|-----------------:|
| Paper 1: first draft     | September 28           |       0          | 
| Paper 1: peer evaluation | October 1              |       5          |
| Paper 1: final draft     | October 6              |       10+        |
| Paper 2: first draft     | October 19             |       0          | 
| Paper 2: peer evaluation | October 23             |       5          |
| Paper 2: final draft     | October 28             |       10+        |
| Paper 3                  | November 10            |       10+        |
| Final project proposal   | November 15(on Piazza) |       5          |
| Final project            | December 4             |       10+        |
| Labs                     |Throughout the semester |       25         |
| Homework (your work)     |Throughout the semester |       25         |
| Homework (evaluations)   |Throughout the semester |       10         |
| Participation in class   |Throughout the semester |       10         |
| Midterm group assessment | October 15             |       10         |
| Final group assessment   | December 1             |       10         |
|--------------------------|:----------------------:|-----------------:|

This set of items totals 145 points. 

Each student may miss one lab and one homework assignment without penalty. If you are going to miss a lab or homework assignment, you should

* Contact your group and tell them that you are unable to work with them that week or on that assignment
* They must mark you as "absent" when they make their submission

Your score will be converted to a percentage and your final grade will be determined from your score as follows:

* 88-100: A
* 80-88: A-
* 75-80: B+
* 70-75: B
* 65-70: B-
* 62-65: C+
* 58-62: C
* 55-58: C-
* 50-55: D
* 0-50: F

**Note that this is a different grading scale than the common one used in American high schools**. I will ask you to do challenging things in this class; I am aware of that, and do not expect everyone to be able to do everything perfectly.

#### Papers 

The papers will be graded out of ten points, although there is no fixed maximum value for your grade; exceptional work will get substantial extra credit. (Both Dr. Freeman and the lab TA's will be helping grade the papers.)
We will be grading on the basis of:

* astronomical insight and factual correctness
* clarity of writing, including correct use of astronomical terminology. Note that we will not penalize students for spelling or minor grammar issues, and will be particularly lenient to students who have not lived for long in an English-speaking country. I’m more interested in whether your ideas fit together to tell a coherent story.
* ambition and creativity
* **We are not looking for perfection; we are looking for insight.** I am aware that many of you speak English as a second language. Don’t worry about your English skills; I want to know what you think. If you need help with your writing, we have 
multiple resources available for you -- the Writing Center, and a few coaches who have specialized skills in helping students with their writing.

### Academic integrity

Our university's motto is "Suos cultores scientia coronat" -- "knowledge crowns those who seek her". Our class's theme is a variant on this: "Science allows us to
write our own future." The most valuable thing you will gain from your education here isn't a degree or a bunch of marks on your transcript: it is the power to influence your world that you will gain from the things you learn.

As such, if you pass off someone else's work as your own in this class, you are cheating yourself out of the value of education itself. You are likely also letting the other two people in your group down. This class is designed
so that any student who works hard and keeps up will pass. You do not need to substitute someone else's work or knowledge for your own; your own talents, your own skill, and your own work are enough.

While you are encouraged to discuss everything in the course with your peers, all work you submit must reflect your own understanding. We may impose a grade sanction up to course failure for any instance of academic dishonesty. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy governs general expectations for students and is incorporated into this syllabus by reference. 

Many of your assignments will be group assignments in which a group of people will work closely together in preparing their work. Sometimes we may ask everyone in the group to submit an individual copy; other times we may ask for each group to submit their assignment only once. Regardless, we expect each person to have participated meaningfully in the work, and each person needs to understand everything that you are submitting. Submitting a group assignment that you did not contribute to, or do not understand, is a form of academic dishonesty.

Likewise, making a false statement about a group member's contributions is also a form of academic dishonesty. 

You will write some papers this semester. In these, you must show clearly which text is original to you, which reflects ideas which you found elsewhere but have digested and expressed in your own words, and which text is a direct quote from someone else’s words.
You must cite any references that you use. (You do not need to cite anything from the course textbook, notes, or lectures.) If you consult a webpage or book for information, you should tell us this. We don’t care what citation style you use.

Direct quotes must be indicated, as must extensive near-direct paraphrases (i.e. taking the organization and content of someone else’s writing and merely replacing words with synonyms, reordering words, omitting sentences or phrases, etc.). This is done by either blockquoting the other writer’s text or by putting it in quotation marks. In general, however, you should use direct quotes only sparingly in your writing.

**A note on Chegg and similar platforms:** You are not allowed to post any materials from our class to Chegg’s “ask an expert” platform or any similar platform soliciting solutions to copy. Our experience has shown that these platforms are overwhelmingly used for academic dishonesty, i.e. to copy things without doing the work or understanding the process. 
Instead, you should collaborate with your classmates or ask one of your instructors for help. The best way to do this is to post a question on Piazza. We will almost certainly be more helpful than anonymous people over the internet in helping you learn the material and gain skills and understanding. It is an extremely serious breach of academic integrity to solicit solutions to homework or exams from Chegg or similar, since this also facilitates the academic dishonesty of others.

I filed academic integrity charges against over 200 people last semester after I found solutions to my final exam on the internet; let's not have a repeat this year.

### Students with disabilities

If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact the Center for Disability Resources (CDR)
at <a href="http://disabilityservices.syr.edu">disabilityservices.syr.edu</a>, located in Room 309 of 8047 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498, TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations and will issue students with documented Disabilities Accommodation Authorization Letters, as appropriate. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible.

**CDR also helps students with short-term injuries**. If you have a concussion, a broken hand, or the like, *please let us know* so we can help you.

More generally, if there is anything I can do to help you, whether it is related to a disability, a medical condition, or anything else, please let me know. I have an excellent working relationship with CDR and will do anything in my power to make your experience in my class a good one.

### Religious and personal observances 

*(The following is common to all SU classes)*

SU’s religious observances notification and policy, found at http://hendricks.syr.edu/spiritual-life/index.html, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented among the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holidays according to their tradition. Under the policy, students are provided an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance provided they notify their instructors before the end of the second week of classes. An online notification process is available for students in My Slice / StudentServices / Enrollment / MyReligiousObservances / Add a Notification.

*(The following is specific to my classes)*

Events of equal solemnity to major religious observances, occurring on inflexible dates, will be given the same deference as religious observances. This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of immediate family members, funerals, caregiving duties for sick family members, other family emergencies or singularly-important events, job interviews, and the like. 

Participation in political or social activism occurring on inflexible dates – attending a demonstration, canvassing for a campaign, or the like – will be given this same deference. 

If you must miss your lab because of a solemn observance, social or political activism, illness or injury, or academic conflict, please discuss this with your group and arrange to attend at a different time that week.
