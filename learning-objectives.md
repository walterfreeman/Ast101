### Learning Objectives, long version

After this class, students will be able to...

1. Philosophy and History of Science (throughout the whole course)
* describe the characteristics of scientific thought and its place within human intellectual endeavor 
* recognize the special historical role of astronomy as a bridge between science and the humanities
* explain the basics of the philosophy of humanism, and how scientific development is one manifestation of it
* create rhetoric, art, writing, and the like that blends astronomical ideas with other academic fields
* recognize and rebut (pseudo)scientific and denialist rhetoric that is dishonest or misleading
<br>

2. Astronomy by Eye (Unit 1)
* describe the actual motions of the Sun, Earth, Moon, planets, and stars, using both words and pictures
* discuss how the apparent motion of celestial bodies in the sky is a consequence of the relative movements of the Earth and those bodies
* predict the apparent motion of those things
* describe how the "celestial sphere model", formulated without the knowledge that the Earth moves around the Sun, still makes reasonably accurate predictions
* describe the causes of the seasons and the moon phases
* predict the differences in the sky, seasons, etc., between different places on Earth
<br>

3. History of Celestial Mechanics (Unit 2)
* describe the state of astronomical knowledge in ancient times, both what was known and what was not
* describe the role of model-building in the scientific method
* describe in particular the Ptolemaic geocentric model, and the nature of Greco-Egyptian thought that produced it
* explain how the features of this model relate to the accuracy of its predictions
* describe the features of the Copernican heliocentric model, and (from a philosophical standpoint) how it amounted to "two steps forward, one step back"
* explain Galileo's arguments for heliocentrism based on his telescopic observations, and the political and theological fallout from them
* describe how advances in precision measurements, made by Brahe and interpreted by Kepler, ruled out circular motion of celestial bodies
* predict the details of the motion of planets around the Sun from Kepler's laws
* describe how Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation, and the conservation of energy, provide a physical basis for Kepler's laws
* use Newton's laws of motion and gravitation to predict how objects will move in a variety of circumstances
* explain the relation of this process to the birth of modern science
<br>

4. Light and Matter / The Sun (Unit 3)
* describe the basic nature of light as a dual particle/wave phenomenon, and the unity of the electromagnetic spectrum
* use spectra to characterize the amount, color, and character of light coming from an object in quantitative ways
* describe the relation of an object's temperature to the thermal radiation it emits
* describe the basic nature of the energy levels in an atom
* relate the emission/absorption of photons to energy-level transitions (in atoms and otherwise)
* predict the emission and absorption spectra of atoms based on their energy levels
* predict the spectra that result from various processes, including those in stars
* describe how the composition of the Sun and other stars can be deduced from its spectrum
* explain why the spectra of all stars are similar, and the broader impact this insight has for philosophy and the humanities
* describe the basics of the Sun's energy source, nuclear fusion
* describe the basic properties of non-light astronomical observations: neutrino astronomy and gravitational-wave observations
<br>

5. Humans and the Cosmos (Unit 4)
* explain the basics of the origin of the Solar System from a collapsing nebula
* describe how radioisotope dating can be used to discover the ages of planets, including the Earth
* perform simple calculations to compute ages of objects from isotope ratios
* describe the basic properties of Mercury, Venus, the Earth, the Moon, Mars, and the gas giants
* explain how the balance between incoming and outgoing thermal radiation sets the temperature of planets
* explain how atmospheric absorption can modify this balance via the "greenhouse effect"
* describe the evidence for human-caused climate change, its history, the history of the Earth's climate, and its possible futures
* explain the basic physics of rocketry
* describe the history of spaceflight and the relation between the race to the Moon and Cold War geopolitics
* describe the current state of spaceflight, and the near-term prospects for a mission to Mars
* describe the barriers to human flight to outer planets and the stars, and how they might be overcome
* discuss the prospects for extraterrestrial life, where it might be found, and how we might recognize it
