For Project 5, we won't be doing peer evaluations.


If you are comfortable using Google Docs, this will be easiest for you. Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxEynMKoJTiWA_QXMA50jxzYFacAa_lZnJIhdtP4omg/">Google Docs version</a>; make sure you click "Make a Copy" and share that copy with your group.

You can also download a <a href="project5.docx">Microsoft Word version</a>. Please let me know if you have compatibility problems with it.
